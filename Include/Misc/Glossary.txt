                     years, and meeting other requirements (as set by each
                     state). See seizin.
Affidavit - A statement in writing, sworn to before proper authority.
A Frame - A measuring device built in the shape of an A. The distance between
          the legs is 6.6 feet (one tenth of a chain. To measure the acreage
          of a small square parcel, multiply the width and height in "A's"
          and move the decimal point three places to the left. For example,
          a square that is 6 A's wide and 4 A's tall is .024 acres.
Ahnentafel - Ancestor table, tabulates the ancestry of one individual
             by generation in text rather than pedigree chart format. A
             comprehensive ahnentafel gives more than the individual's name,
             date and place of birth, christening, marriage, death and
             burial. It should give biographical and historical commentary
             for each person listed, as well as footnotes citing the source
             documents used to prove what is stated.
Ahnentafel Number - The unique number assigned to each position in an
                    ancestor table is called an ahnentafel number. Number one
                    designates the person in the first generation. Numbers
                    two and three designate the parents of number one and the
                    second generation. Numbers four through seven designate
                    the grandparents of person number one and the third
                    generation. As the ahnentafel extends by generation,
                    the number of persons doubles.

Alien - Foreigner; (or Aliene, Alienate) to transfer or make over to another;

          location within the section, for example, the northwest quarter
          of the southeast quarter.
Allodial - see alodium
Allowances - A deduction of acreage reserved for a specific purpose, such as
             a public road, highway or right-of-way. In colonial New Jersey,
             the King's Highways were by law to be six rods (ninety-nine
             feet) in breadth. If a highway was a property boundary (which
             was typical), then the allowance would be half this measure,
             or 49.5 feet.
Alodium - Land owned independently, without rent or other obligation to
          another. See Freehold Estate. The alodial (also 'allodial')

                 Department of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
                 Saints (LDS Church), links individuals to ancestors in
                 pedigree, family group, and descendant formats. It contains
                 genealogical information about millions of people from
                 many nations.

           whose existence can be documented in surviving records.
Anon. - Abbreviation for anonymous.
Annotation - Interpretation, explanation, clarification, definition, or
             supplement. Many types of genealogical presentations contain
             statements, record sources, documents, conclusions, or other
             historical information that require an annotation. Generally,
             annotations appear in footnotes, end-notes, or in the text
             itself. Genealogical software provides a field for documentation,
             comments, notes, and analysis. Genealogists use annotations
             to explain discrepancies between two or more documents, to
             add information from another source to support a statement or
             conclusion made in a different record, and other difficult to

Chain - See measurements.
Chain Bearer - (CB) - Also known as chain carrier or sworn chain carrier
               (CC, SCC): they were land surveyor's assistants; handled
               measuring chain. Generally, there was a legal requirement
               that chain carriers take an oath as to the honesty of
               their work; therefore the chain carrier should have been
               of legal age.  It was a common practice for a member of
               the family to serve as a chain bearer for the surveyor. In
               Robert Gibson's 1796 Treatise of Practical Surveying he
               commented that, "The surveyor should be careful to have
               his chain measured before he proceeds [on surveys]..." for
               consistent precision. In the Speculation Lands Collection
               each individual survey consisted of two chain bearers (item
               0712 comprises of three). The rear man or "hinder chainman"
               stood by the starting stake with one end of the chain while
               the front man, carrying the other end unrolled the chain
               as he went toward a mark. Furthermore, Gibson argued that
               the success of a survey, depended on the care and skill of
               the rear chain bearer. He had to ensure that the front man
               was always in line with the mark. "The inaccuracies of most
               surveys arise from bad chaining" recorded Gibson.
Chain carrier - An assistant to the surveyor, the chain carriers moved the
                surveying chain from one location to another under the
                direction of the surveyor. This was a position of some
                responsibility, and the chain carriers took an oath as
                "sworn chain carriers" that they would do their job properly.
Charter - A legal instrument by which a sovereign power assures certain
          rights, liberties or powers. In early New Jersey, charters were
          granted by the governor to the settlers of new towns. See also

                 marriages, and burials. The type of information you will
                 find in the records are the name(s) of the individual(s)
                 involved, the date of the event, the location of the
                 event, and the clergyman's name. You may find additional
                 information, such as parents' names (father's full name and

         ownership were issued to the landowner.

              bequeathed to four children and one dies, the heirs of the

                but a way to gain one, as by adverse possession. This is

                should be its owner.
