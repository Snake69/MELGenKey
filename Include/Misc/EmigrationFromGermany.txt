Miscellaneous Facts relating to German emigration

From 1816 to 1914 roughly 5 million Germans came to the USA.
In 1900 10% of the population of the USA was German.
In 1990 28% (52 million) of Americans claim a German ancestry.
From 1880 to 1891 1.5 million people left Germany.
In 1891 the census of Germany claimed 49 million people.
In 1891 115,392 people emigrated from Germany, roughly 100,000 to the USA.
From 1850 to 1860 950,000 people left Germany.
From 1946 to 1961 780,000 people left Germany, 50% of which came to the USA.

The period following the Napoleonic wars and particularly the starvation
winter of 1816/17 influenced many to leave.  Political lack of freedom,
demagogic rulers, economic difficulties among farmers and tradesmen started
the ball rolling.  Farm reform that permitted only the oldest to retain
access to the family property left many without a means of earning a living.
Tenant farmers who did not own anything resisted the virtual slave life
they were leading while working for a larger landholder.

The exodus of 1817 (starvation) through 1848 (revolutionary activities put
down by the nobility) started in the Rhineland, Baden, and Wuertemberg.
People from Hessia, Westphalia, Hannover, and Oldenburg followed in waves.
Initially it was farmers and tradesmen, later intellectuals and professionals
followed.

After the unification of Germany in 1872 the German government needed workers
and attempted to reduce emigration, yet, over the next 15 years, another
1.5 million people left.  Most were from the eastern areas of Prussia,
Mecklenburg, and some from the industrialized Ruhr.  Contributing factors
were the Prussian 3 year compulsory draft and the reorganization of farm life.
Losses of rights to land left many without meaningful work.

By the end of the century 672,000 farms in the US were run by German farmers.
The German farm belt was roughly from Ohio to Nebraska in the west, and
from Wisconsin in the north to Missouri in the south.  Others also settled
many areas in Texas.

Except for the immigrants, who followed workers from earlier waves, after
World War I and refugees from the east after World War II, emigration came
pretty much to a halt around the turn of the century.  Still, the mark
the Germans left on this country is everywhere from George Westinghous
who invented the air brake, to John A. Roebling, builder of bridges after
inventing steel wire, to Ottmar Mergenthaler who gave the New York Times
the Linotype typesetting machine, to Herr Steinweg from Wolfshagen in Lower
Saxony, who gave us the Steinway piano.

Any genealogy should include some reference to why and where our ancestors
came from.  The circumstances of their risky venture to America are often
forgotten but the history books give us a glimpse as to where they fit in
to a larger picture.
