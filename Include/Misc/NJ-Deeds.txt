  Sara - Well, an Indenture is just an agreement to sell and many times
the agreement is not completed until years later. It could be that the
agreement was never completed until 1751.

  The more probable answer is that the instrument for the land was never
acknowledged before a Judge. It was probably written up at someone's home
(a writer) and then put away.  Keep in mind that in that period of time
there was no requirement to record a deed.  You kept that deed to prove it
was your land.  It wasn't until 1785 that most NJ counties began recording
deeds.  Monmouth began recording them very early.  But, before that you
had to travel to either Perth Amboy or to Burlington to record it.

  Think of the person keeping a deed at home without recording it just
like we keep a car's bill of sale.  We only turn it over when we sell the
car and then it is recorded at DMV. In this case, it was probably never
acknowledged before a Judge and it was necessary to do so in 1751 before
it the new owner had a valid document.

  With a deed, you want to have it acknowledged before a judge where the
person selling or witnessing it swears before a judge that they were present
and saw the person sign same. It is proof of the sale being legit. Otherwise,
someone could write up a deed for your property, as though it was his,
and sell it to someone else and have it acknowledged before a judge.

  So, either Jonathan or the grantee kept his deed hidden in a box, etc,
and then when Jonathan was leaving in 1751, it was taken to be recorded
but it was found that it had never been acknowledged before a Judge, so
Jonathan or the owner had to obtain the witnesses and have them re-witness
it by appearing before a Judge in 1751, and acknowledging they were present
and saw it signed and they signed same making it a legit document.

  Many times a deed was held so long that the witnesses died before it was
acknowledged before a Judge. This was resolved by a son, or other family
member or a close friend, businessman, etc. appearing before the Judge
and swearing that he was familiar with the person's handwriting and verily
believes that the handwriting on the deed in question was that of the person.

  Many times when a date, as in your example, is so much later (1751) than
the sale date (1742) it is an important genealogical clue.  Many times it
signifies that the person holding the deed (grantor) is selling the property
(or his estate) because he either moved or died. It could also have been when
the debt for the sale was finalized - 1751. An Indenture is the real language
of what is written and is basically just a written agreement.  That is why
when working with deeds, always note the date of an acknowledgement before
a Judge as it can serve as a clue to movement of the grantor or grantee.

  I have seen in the 1700s where one person begins selling his property
because he is moving or dying and you see deed after deed from the grantee
being recorded in the county or state books.  A definite indication that
the grantee kept all the deeds he was given by the grantor when he bought
the property, had them acknowledged, then had them all recorded at one
time many years later when selling it or nearing death.  And, these deeds
represented a chain of title for the same.

  I have many of these deeds I am working on from the 1600s never being
acknowledged until 1700s.  The oldest one I have seen is the Hightstown
Baptist Church for land in Hightstown ca. 1785 and not acknowledged and
recorded until 1940s.

  Hope I haven't confused you.  Hutch
