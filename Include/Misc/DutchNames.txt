ENGLISH EQUIVALENTS OF DUTCH NAMES

Difficulty is sometimes experienced in the examination of church records
in this region (and the same occurs in the records in family Bibles
and inscriptions on tombstones) by the want of familiarity with Dutch
nomenclature. OLDE ULSTER has been requested to assist the inexperienced
in such matters.

The following list gives the English equivalent of many of the more
puzzling of Dutch Christian names. The final "je" in which so many Dutch
names end bears the same relation to them which the "ie" of the English
names does to the English. It is a diminutive and applied as a pet name. It
is pronounced ye. It is usually applied to women's names but often to those
of boys.  There are many instances in which it is applied to men. It was
no more common for the Dutch to call Anna " Antje" than for the English to
call it "Annie." A familiar instance of the diminutive given to men is yet
to be found in this county in the modification of the name Cornelius. It is
still common to call Cornelius "Case." This is a corruption. The diminutive
is correctly given in the list as "Keesje."
