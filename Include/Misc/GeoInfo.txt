USA:

Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia are Commonwealths;
all other states are States.

Louisiana has Parishes rather than Counties; Alaska has Boroughs and
Unorganized Boroughs rather than Counties; all other states have Counties.
New York, Wisconsin and New England counties have Towns; all other State
Counties have Townships (recall, Louisiana and Alaska do not have Counties).

Counties may contain a number of cities, towns, villages or hamlets, or
sometimes just a part of a city. Some cities are consolidated with, and
coterminous with, their counties, including Philadelphia, Honolulu, San
Francisco, Nashville, and Denver - that is to say, these counties consist
in their entirety of a single municipality the government of which also
operates as the county government. Each of the five boroughs of New York
City is coterminous with a county. Some counties, such as Arlington County,
Virginia, do not have any additional subdivisions. Some states contain
independent cities that are not part of any county.

Some Townships or other incorporated areas like villages, boroughs,
plantations and hamlets have governments and political power; others are
simply geographic designations.


Germany:

Germany was unified in 1871. Before that it was a collection of regions,
all of which had their own designation. Up to the very early 19th century,
the "Holy Roman Empire" was the name for the political entity that covered
most of what became the German Empire in 1871 (the "Holy Roman Empire"
seems to have ended in 1807).
