Some facts on aging

Scientific progress has enabled life expectancy at birth in the United
States to grow from 47 years in 1900 to 75 years in 1991.

The largest number of Americans ever -- over 57,000 -- are living past
their 100th birthday.

Americans over age 85 are growing six times faster than the rest of the
U.S. population.

More than 6,000 Americans celebrate their 65th birthday each day and more
than 3,800 Americans celebrate their 75th birthday each day.

The average life expectancy for women in the U.S. will top 80 years old in
this decade.

The first "baby boomers" will begin turning age 65 in just 20 years.

In 20 years, the number of Americans over age 65 will more than double to
65 million.

In 2030 we will have more senior citizens than children for the first time
in U.S. history.

Almost one of every two Americans who will turn age 65 this year can expect
to enter a nursing home at least once before they die.

Half of all Americans over age 85 need help performing basic activities of
daily living such as eating, bathing, and dressing.

The leading cause of death among senior citizens is heart disease.

The leading type of fatal injury for seniors is falls.

As many as 14 million Americans living today are at risk of contracting
Alzheimer's disease unless a cure is found.

The number of older Americans in 1870: 1 million; in 1990: 31.6 million.

The 65-plus American population is currently larger than the entire population
of Canada.

The odds of living to be 100 for a baby born in 1879 were 400 to 1; the
odds of living to be 100 for a baby born in 1990 were 87 to 1.
