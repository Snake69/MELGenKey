14 Aug 1945 Japan surrenders, ending World War II. That night, U.S. Army
              officers Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel consult a National
              Geographic map of Asia to determine the postwar dividing line
              between Soviet and U.S. zones of control in Korea. Neither
              man is an expert on the country, and, failing to find any
              obvious natural barrier between the North and the South,
              they select the 38th parallel, a border that was tentatively
              proposed at the Potsdam Conference. This division places the
              capital city of Seoul in the American zone but just 35 miles
              south of the dividing line. [2]
   Sep 1945 One of the penalties imposed on Japan at the end of World
              War II was the loss of Korea. A precursor of the causes
              of this mid-century Korean War was the decision to divide
              (rather than unify) Korea along the 38th parallel. Soviet
              Union controlled the north as a result of entering the war
              against Japan during the last days of World War II and the
              United States the southern half of the peninsular. [3]
15 Aug 1948 The Republic of Korea (South Korea) is established. Less than
              a month later the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
              (North Korea) is established. [2]
 1 Oct 1949 Mao Ze Dung and his communists People's Republic of China was
              established after Chiang Kai-shek evacuated from the mainland
              to the island of Taiwan. [3]
       1950 To respond to the strain on economic and military resources
              caused by the Korean War, President Truman announced a National
              Emergency. This gave him broad economic powers. [7]
            -1953, Korean War, about 3 million people died [8]
12 Jan 1950 In a speech to the National Press Club, U.S. Secretary of State
              Dean Acheson outlines a U.S. Pacific defense posture that
              includes Japan and the Philippines but does not explicitly
              include Korea. In fact, he states that, "so far as the military
              security of other areas in the Pacific is concerned, it must
              be clear that no person can guarantee these areas against
              military attack." [2]
13 Jan 1950 Jacob Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations,
              storms out of a meeting of the UN Security Council after
              the Security Council votes down to replace Chaing Kai Chek's
              Nationalists Chinese representatives with Representatives of
              Mao Ze Dung's Peoples Republic of China. This event begins
              a Soviet Boycott of the United Nations Security Council. [3]
17 Jan 1950 North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung proposes the "liberation" of South
              Korea to Soviet officials. Weeks of telegram exchanges between
              Beijing, Moscow, and P'yongyang follow, and by early spring
              Kim has secured assurances of support for the invasion from
              Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and Chinese leader Mao Zedong. [2]
25 Jun 1950 A massive artillery barrage from the North signals [2] the
              beginning of the Korean War. [2] [15] Roughly 100,000 North
              Korean troops pour across the 38th parallel, and, although South
              Korean forces are driven back, they retire in good order. [2]
              North Korean People's Army (NKPA) numbers approximately 135,000
              men; Republic of Korea (ROK) Army contains 98,000 soldiers. [1]
            United Nations Security Council called into emergency
              session. Soviet Union boycotts session due to permanent
              seating of Taiwan representing China instead of Communist
              mainland government. In Soviet absence and their veto power
              not in effect, Council Resolution 82 passed demanding that
              North Korea end invasion. This legitimized United Nations
              actions and the most dramatic of the early events in the
              pantheon of Korean War facts. [3]
            Worried that South Koreans will join the communists, President
              Syngman Rhee starts the Summer of Terror and orders over
              100,000 people killed. [4]
27 Jun 1950 The United Nations Security Council adopts Resolution 83, [2]
              [3] authorizing UN member states to provide military assistance
              to South Korea. [2] The Soviets, who could have vetoed the
              resolution, are boycotting the proceedings [2] [3] because
              the Nationalist government on Taiwan still occupies China's
              seat on the Security Council. Seoul falls the following day. [2]
            The United States enters the war. [15]
28 Jun 1950 Packed with its own refugees fleeing Seoul and leaving their
             5th Division stranded, South Korean forces blow up the Hangang
             Bridge in an attempt to slow North Korea's offensive. [5]
            NKPA forces capture Seoul. [1] [5] [6]
            Suspected communist sympathizers (between as many as 100,000
              to 200,000) are executed in the Bodo League massacre. [5]
            North Korean Army conducts the Seoul National University Hospital
              massacre. [5]

              by the North Korean army. [4]
 5 Jul 1950 Task Force Smith engages and delays advancing NKPA forces at
              Osan in first U.S. ground action of the war. [1] [5]

              fatality in the Korean War. [6]
 7 Jul 1950 UN passes Resolution 84 requesting member nations to supply
              troops to join a military action under a U.S. commander. 16

 4 Aug 1950 -18 Sep 1950, North Korean troops drove U.S. and ROK forces
              to southeastern corner of South Korea and established a
              defensive position about the port of Pusan and known as the
              Pusan perimeter. [3]
 8 Aug 1950 -18 Aug 1950, NKPA attempts to penetrate Naktong (Pusan)

11 Sep 1950 President Harry S. Truman approved military operations north
              of the 38th parallel. [5]
12 Sep 1950 North Korean troops reach their farthest point of
              advance. Although thousands of UN troops have arrived to
              reinforce South Korea, months of fighting have reduced the area
              under their control to a 5,000-square-mile rectangle centered
              on the critical southeastern port of Pusan. By the time the
              North Korean invasion force reaches the "Pusan Perimeter,"
              its strength has been nearly cut in half and it is almost
              entirely lacking in armor. [2]
15 Sep 1950 X Corps, a force led by U.S. Maj. Gen. Edward M. Almond,
              stages an audacious amphibious landing at Inch'on, some 150
              miles behind enemy lines. The plan, conceived by UN commander
              Gen. Douglas MacArthur, is an unqualified success; 10 days
              later Seoul is liberated. [2]
16 Sep 1950 U.S. Eighth Army begins its offensive northward out of the
              Pusan Perimeter. [1]
20 Sep 1950 1st Marine Division drives northeast across Han River. [1]
23 Sep 1950 The Battle of Hill 282 is the first US friendly-fire incident
              on British military personnel since World War II. [5]
26 Sep 1950 X Corps' 31st Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, moving
              east from Inchon, links up with Eighth Army's 7th Cavalry
              Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, south of Suwon. [1]
29 Sep 1950 -30 Sep 1950, UN forces recapture Seoul and drive
              north. Washington authorizes General McArthur to cross
              northward over the 38th parallel. Chinese premier Zhou Enlai
              warns Washington that China will intervene in the event UN
              forces cross 38th parallel. [3]
 1 Oct 1950 ROK I Corps crosses 38th Parallel and then advances up the east
              coast. [1]
 6 Oct 1950 -7 Oct 1950, Two ROK II Corps divisions cross 38th Parallel in
              central Korea. [1]
 9 Oct 1950 U.S. Eighth Army forces cross 38th Parallel north of Kaesong
              and attack northward toward P'yongyang, the North Korean
              capital. [1]
            The Goyang Geumjeong Cave massacre in Korea begins. [5]
10 Oct 1950 ROK I Corps captures the major port of Wonsan. [1]
12 Oct 1950 First Lieutenant Samuel Coursen of Madison (NJ) was killed
              in action in Korea. Coursen, who had previously earned the
              Bronze and Silver Stars, was posthumously awarded the Medal
              of Honor for his heroism. [12]
14 Oct 1950 -17 Oct 1950, 7th Infantry Division loads on ships at Pusan
              in preparation for amphibious landings by X Corps along the
              northeastern coast above the 38th Parallel. [1]
            -15 Oct 1950, Chinese troops respond to UN crossing 38th parallel
              and enter North Korea crossing international boundary, Yalu
              River. Chinese refer to their soldiers as "volunteers". Almost
              simultaneously with Chinese crossing into N. Korea, General
              McArthur met with President Truman on Wake Island to report
              on the progress of the war and assured Truman that Chinese
              would not intervene. There appeared to be a meeting of the
              minds which would unravel by April. [3]
19 Oct 1950 1st ROK Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division capture P'yongyang,
              [1] the capital of North Korea. [4]

              against the North Koreans during the Battle of Yongju. [5]
25 Oct 1950 Having destroyed the bulk of the North Korean army, UN troops
              have pressed on into North Korea and are now approaching the
              Yalu River. Chinese People's Volunteers Force (CPVF) troops
              under veteran commander Gen. Peng Dehuai cross into North
              Korea and inflict serious losses on the lead units of the
              UN advance. The sudden appearance of Chinese forces sends
              the main body of UN forces reeling back to the south bank
              of the Ch'ongch'on River. [2] The first Chinese soldier is
              captured. [1]
            630 Dutch volunteers depart for Korea [10]

              Brigade successfully halted the advancing Chinese 117th
              Division during the Battle of Pakchon. [5]
 8 Nov 1950 United States Air Force Lt. Russell J. Brown, while piloting an
              F-80 Shooting Star, shoots down two North Korean MiG-15s in the
              first jet aircraft-to-jet aircraft dogfight in history. [5] [6]
11 Nov 1950 X Corps resumes advance north. [1]
21 Nov 1950 Two Canadian National Railway trains collide in northeastern
              British Columbia in the Canoe River train crash; the death
              toll is 21, with 17 of them Canadian troops bound for Korea. [5]
24 Nov 1950 Eighth Army moves north from the Chongchon River. [1]
            McArthur orders a bold offense intending UN troops to drive to
              the Yalu River and tells his troops they will be, "home for
              Christmas". Chinese troops effect an ambush and the drive is
              a disaster including surrounding thousands and US Marines and
              Soldiers near the Chosin Reservior. Over the next three weeks
              US Marines and Soldiers would first defend their positions
              and then conduct offensive actions to retreat out of the area
              toward escape to the sea which would go into the legends of
              military history, especially within the Marine Corps. [3]
25 Nov 1950 Chinese forces attack Eighth Army center and right. [1]
26 Nov 1950 Troops from the People's Republic of China launch a massive
              counterattack in North Korea against South Korean and United
              Nations forces (Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River and Battle
              of Chosin Reservoir), ending any hopes of a quick end to the
              conflict. [5]

              forces strike X Corps at Chosin Reservoir. [1]
29 Nov 1950 Eighth Army begins general withdrawal from Chongchon River line
              to defensive line at P'yongyang. [1]
            -1 Dec 1950, Chinese forces devastate U.S. 2d Infantry Division
              as it guards Eighth Army withdrawal. [1]
30 Nov 1950 X Corps starts retreat to port of Hungnam. [1]
 2 Dec 1950 Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River ended, with decisive Chinese
              victory, UN forces were completely expelled from North
              Korea. [5]
 4 Dec 1950 In North Korea the US Navy's first black pilot, Ensign Jesse
              Brown, was downed in his fighter plane in the Jangjin
              Reservoir. Wing man Lt. j.g. Thomas Hudner crashed landed
              his plane in a failed attempt to save Brown. In 2013 Hudner
              returned to the site of the crash. [9]
 5 Dec 1950 Eighth Army falls back from P'yongyang. [1]
 6 Dec 1950 The U.S. Marines at the Chosin Reservoir begin their "attack in
              a different direction" as they engage in a fighting retreat to
              the port of Hŭngnam. Two entire Chinese armies have been tasked
              with the destruction of the 1st Marine Division. They succeed
              in driving the American force from North Korean territory but
              pay an enormous price: as many as 80,000 Chinese troops are
              killed or wounded, and the CPVF Ninth Army Group is rendered
              combat-ineffective for months. "Frozen Chosin" becomes one
              of the most-storied episodes in U.S. Marine Corps history. [2]

              again liberate the South Korean capital. The city has been
              devastated by fighting, and its population has been reduced
              to a fraction of its prewar size. [2]
31 Mar 1951 Eighth Army is positioned along the Idaho line. [1]
 2 Apr 1951 -5 Apr 1951, General Ridgeway puts Operation RUGGED into motion;
              the objective is Line Kansas, some ten miles above the 38th
              Parallel. [1]
 9 Apr 1951 The I and IX Corps and the ROK I Corps reach the Kansas line;
              the two U.S. corps continue to advance farther north. [1]
11 Apr 1951 McArthur increasingly at odds with Truman over strategies. The
              general publicly declaring a desire to blockade Chinese coast
              and bomb their mainland. Truman fearful that this would invite
              Soviet entry into the war. A potential prelude to World War
              III. U.S. Pres. Harry S. Truman relieves MacArthur of command
              [1] [2] [3] for insubordination and his unwillingness to
              prosecute a limited war. [2] He is succeeded as UN commander
              by Lieut. Gen. Matthew Ridgway. [1] [2] [3]
14 Apr 1951 General Van Fleet assumes command of Eighth Army. [1]
22 Apr 1951 The expected Chinese and North Korean spring offensive begins,
              with the strongest attacks in the west, toward Seoul. [1]
            The Chinese People's Volunteer Army begin assaulting positions
              defended by the Royal Australian Regiment and the Princess
              Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry at the Battle of Kapyong. [5]
25 Apr 1951 Vastly outnumbered UN forces check the Chinese advance on
              Seoul at the Battles of Kapyong and the Imjin River. Two
              Commonwealth battalions-the 2nd Battalion of the Princess
              Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Regiment and the 3rd
              Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment-rebuff an entire
              Chinese division at Kapyong, and 4,000 men of the British
              29th Brigade stage a successful delaying action against nearly
              30,000 troops of the Chinese 63rd Army at the Imjin River. Some
              650 men of the 1st Battalion, the Gloucestershire Regiment
              (the "Glorious Glosters"), engage in a Thermopylae-like stand
              against more than 10,000 Chinese infantry at Imjin. Although the
              overwhelming majority of the Glosters are killed or captured,
              their sacrifice allows UN forces to consolidate their lines
              around the South Korean capital. [2]
30 Apr 1951 The enemy offensive is stopped just north of Seoul. [1]
15 May 1951 -20 May 1951, The Chinese and North Koreans resume the offensive,
              focusing on the east-central region; General Van Fleet begins
              a counterattack. [1]
31 May 1951 The Eighth Army advances nearly to Line Kansas. [1]
 1 Jun 1951 General Van Fleet strengthens the Kansas line and sends forces
              farther north, toward Line Wyoming. [1]
23 Jun 1951 The Soviet Union calls for armistice talks. [1]
10 Jul 1951 Truce talks between the UN and the communists begin at
              Kaesong. [1] [2] [3] [5] The negotiations do not mark an
              end to the war, however; the fighting continues for two more
              years. In October the peace talks relocate to the village of
              P'anmunjom. [2]
            Belligerents' forces face each other over the 38th parallel. [3]
23 Aug 1951 Communist side breaks off negotiations. [1]
 5 Sep 1951 North Koreans abandon Bloody Ridge, after UN forces, led by
              U.S. 2d Infantry Division's 9th Infantry, outflank it. [1]

              French troops start a battle with North Korean and Chinese
              troops in a part of South Korea known as the Punchbowl. The
              U.S. and France win the month-long battle. [4]
 3 Oct 1951 -19 Oct 1951, Five UN divisions advance to Line Jamestown,
              some four miles beyond the Wyoming line, to protect the
              Seoul-Chorwon railway. [1]

              Regiment defends a vital area against a full battalion
              of Chinese troops in the Battle of the Song-gok Spur. The
              engagement lasts into the early hours the next day. [5]
12 Nov 1951 General Ridgway, the UNC commander, instructs General Van Fleet
              to cease Eighth Army offensive operations and to assume an
              "active defense." [1]
27 Nov 1951 -Apr 1952, New truce talks commence in tents at Panmunjom,
              North Korea. Parties agreed on truce line, 38th parallel,
              but could not agree on nature of prisoner exchange. Both
              sides relatively inactive during heavy winter weather, and
              casualties commensurately reduced. [3]
12 May 1952 General Mark W. Clark assumes command of the UNC. [1]
   Jun 1952 -Jul 1952, Both sides had utilized the prior relative winter
              calm to strengthen their positions and engaged in fierce
              artillery battles and limited outpost skirmishes. [3]
   Aug 1952 -Sep 1952, The battle for hills and ridges began a new aspect to
              the war. The control of the mountainous redoubts was considered
              a first line of defense for each side. Battles were inconclusive
              with control changing hands constantly. Although limited in
              scope, casualties weighed heavily on American leaders. Major
              battles include Battle of Bunker Hill and Hill 122 which saw
              the first Major Marine Combat in Western Korea, and on 29
              August the UN launched the war's largest air raid of over
              1,4000 Sorties flown. [3]
 8 Oct 1952 UN delegation calls an indefinite recess to armistice talks,
              reflecting a long lack of any progress. [1]
14 Oct 1952 In an effort to convince the Chinese of their intentions to
              prosecute the war, Americans mounted large offensive to take
              Triangle Hill, but were unsuccessful after heavy casualties
              on both sides. Thereafter, the sides retired to their winter
              positions and repeated the 1951 scenario. [3] The Battle of
              Triangle Hill is the biggest and bloodiest battle of 1952. [5]
29 Nov 1952 U.S. President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower fulfills a campaign
              promise by traveling to Korea to find out what can be done
              to end the conflict. [5]
   Jan 1953 Dwight Eisenhower elected president after campaigning to conclude
              the war. Nevertheless, communist leaders were fearful that
              this election might signal a hard line to continue the war. [3]
11 Feb 1953 Lt. Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor takes command of the Eighth Army. [1]
   Mar 1953 Joseph Stalin dies shifting Soviet's position on the war.
26 Apr 1953 Negotiators return to Panmunjom and Communists agree to voluntary
              repatriation. [3]
27 Apr 1953 Operation Moolah offers $50,000 to any pilot who defected with
              a fully mission-capable Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 to South
              Korea. The first pilot was to receive $100,000. [5]

   May 1953 Communist forces commence new attacks hoping that additional
              territorial gains would strengthen their positions in the
              final armistice terms. [3]
   Jun 1953 While the negotiators hammered out details of the agreement,
              Communist forces commenced a new offensive attaining several
              miles of new territory. Historians look at this Korean War
              fact and believe these last "minute" actions were meant to
              bolster a history of communist victories. In response the Navy
              and Marine Corps aircraft fly 910 Sorties (Highest single
              day total on June 15) and the air forces destroy 16 MIG's
              (Largest single day total on June 26th). [3]
 6 Jul 1953 A last communist successful offensive to dislodge Americans
              from a hill outpost called "Old Baldy". [3]
            -11 Jul 1953, General Taylor abandons Pork Chop Hill, a 7th
              Infantry Division outpost, to the Chinese as not worth further
              fighting. [1]
13 Jul 1953 -20 Jul 1953, Chinese launch a six-division attack against ROK
              II Corps and U.S. IX Corps south of Kumsong; after falling
              back some eight miles to below the Kumsong River, UN forces
              regain the high ground along the river. [1]
26 Jul 1953 Soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment
              repel a number of Chinese assaults against a key position
              known as The Hook during the Battle of the Samichon River,
              just hours before the Armistice Agreement is signed, ending
              the Korean War. [5]
27 Jul 1953 Mark W. Clark for the UN Command, Peng Dehuai for the Chinese,
              and Kim Il-Sung for North Korea conclude an armistice ending
              hostilities. A demilitarized zone is created that roughly
              follows the prewar border along the 38th parallel. South
              Korean Pres. Syngman Rhee announces his acceptance of the
              agreement, but no representative of South Korea ever signs the
              document. [2] After three years, one month, and two days of
              fighting, the Korean War officially ended. The United States
              suffered 33,327 deaths and 102,000 wounded. The cost of the
              war was over $18 billion. Under the terms of the cease-fire,
              Korea would be divided at the 38th parallel, as it was the
              day the Communists attacked. The first truce talks had begun
              on 10 Jul 1951. A cease-fire agreement was quickly reached in
              almost all areas, with the exception of a prisoner-exchange. The
              United Nations forces refused to return prisoners who did not
              want to be repatriated. Two more years of fighting ensued and
              only a threat by President Eisenhower to use nuclear weapons
              finally brought about an armistice. [14] The United States,
              China and North Korea sign an armistice agreement. Syngman
              Rhee, President of South Korea, refuses to sign but pledges
              to observe the armistice. [5]
 5 Aug 1953 Operation Big Switch begins as the remaining prisoners taken
              during the Korean War are exchanged at Panmunjom. [11]
21 Sep 1953 Lieutenant No Kum-sok, a North Korean pilot, defects to South
              Korea with his jet fighter. [5]
 1 Oct 1953 A Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the
              Republic of Korea is concluded in Washington, D.C. [5]
