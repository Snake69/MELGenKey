              Versailles Treaty, together with his denunciation of Jews, was
              hugely popular in a Germany suffering from high unemployment
              and inflation. This appeal, however, failed to win him the
              election. General Hindenberg won instead. In July's Reichstag
              elections, the Nazis won the largest number of seats, but not
              a majority. No coalition government could be formed, and once
              again elections were called. Again the results were inconclusive.
              In January, the centrists entered into a coalition with Hitler,
              making him the new Prime Minister of Germany. In February,
              the Reichstag burned down, and Hitler charged the fire had
              been the work of the Communists. He arrested all the Communist
              members of the parliament. Elections held a week later gave
              the Nazis only 44 percent of the votes. With the Communists
              in prison, however, Hitler was able to get the Reichstag to
              pass the Enabling Act. This made Hitler a dictator, removed
              Jews and other "undesirables" from all position of power and
              dissolved the Reichstag. Europe had entered into a dark era. [2]

                   During the war, the government mobilizes Canadian money,
              supplies, and volunteers to support Britain while boosting
              the economy and maintaining home front morale. Canada plays a
              military role protecting convoys against German submarines and
              fighting the German Army in Western Europe, while helping to
              liberate the Netherlands. Canada expands its small navy into
              the third largest in the world, after the U.S. and U.K. It
              had 363 ships and 100,000 sailors (of whom 6700 were women.) [1]

              the allotment of German economic resources. This is the first
              and only time the Kriegsmarine is given the first priority in
              the history of the Third Reich. [1]

              defensive line with the annexation of the Sudetenland. [1]
            Germany establishes the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The
              Second Czechoslovak Republic is dissolved. [1]

              begins with Japan and Manchukuo against the Soviet Union and
              Mongolia. The battle ends in Soviet victory on September 16,
              influencing the Japanese not to seek further conflict with
              the Soviets, but to turn towards the Pacific holdings of the
              Euro-American powers instead. [1]
17 May 1939 Sweden, Norway, and Finland reject Germany's offer of
              non-aggression pacts. [1]

              Friendship and Alliance between Germany and Italy", is signed by
              Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany [1] (Mussolini and Hitler). [2]
              The Pact declares further cooperation between the two powers,
              but in a secret supplement the Pact is detailed as a military
              alliance. [1]
14 Jun 1939 The Tientsin Incident occurs, in which the Japanese blockade
              the British concession in the North China Treaty Port of
              Tientsin. [1]
10 Jul 1939 Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain reaffirms support for Poland
              and makes it clear that Britain did not view Free City of Danzig
              as being an internal German-Polish affair and would intervene
              on behalf of Poland if hostilities broke out between the two
              countries. [1]
 2 Aug 1939 The Einstein-Szilard letter is sent to President
              Roosevelt. Written by Leó Szilárd and signed by Albert
              Einstein, it warned of the danger that Germany might develop
              atomic bombs. This letter prompted action by Roosevelt and
              eventually resulted in the Manhattan Project. [1]
23 Aug 1939 In a stunning move, the Nazis and the Soviet Union signed a
              Non-Aggression Pact [1] [2] (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). [1]
              The pact, whose terms were kept secret at the time, called
              for the dividing up of lands between Germany and the Soviet
              Union. Germany was to receive Western Poland and Lithuania,
              while the Soviet Union would get Eastern Poland, Estonia, Latvia
              and Finland. The Soviets had previously been negotiating with
              France and Great Britain on a mutual assistance pact. Stalin,
              however, had lost faith in the British and French ability
              to deal with the Germans. The Soviets had demanded the
              right to send troops into Poland in case of a German attack,
              something that the Poles refused to permit. Thus, no agreement
              could be reached on mutual defense. The Non-Aggression Pact
              decisively changed the European balance of power in favor of
              the Germans. [2] This protocol removes the threat of Soviet
              intervention during the German invasion of Poland. [1]
25 Aug 1939 The United Kingdom and Poland form a military alliance in which
              the UK promises to defend Poland in case of invasion by a
              foreign power. [1]
            In response to a message from Mussolini that Italy will not
              honor the Pact of Steel if Germany attacks Poland, Hitler delays
              the launch of the invasion by five days to provide more time
              to secure British and French neutrality. [1]
27 Aug 1939 The German aircraft firm of Heinkel tested the first jet powered
              aircraft. The plane, which was named the "Heinkel He 178,"
              [1] [2] proved the feasibility of jet aircraft. [2]
30 Aug 1939 German ultimatum to Poland concerning the Polish Corridor and
              the Free City of Danzig. [1]
31 Aug 1939 Nazi Germany mounts a false flag attack on the Gleiwitz radio
              station, creating an excuse to attack Poland the following day,
              thus starting World War II in Europe. [1]
 1 Sep 1939 The German-Polish Crisis began in March, when the German
              government demanded that Danzig be turned over to Germany. In
              addition, the Germans demanded the right to construct an
              extra-territorial railroad across the corridor. The Poles
              refused, and the French and British pledged to aid the
              Poles. After the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact, all
              attempts at negotiations failed and the Germans and Poles
              mobilized for war. The British and the French did the same,
              reasserting that they would come to the defense of Poland. [2]
              Without response to its ultimatum, Germany invades Poland,
              start of World War II. The Invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany
              starts at 4:45 a.m. with the Luftwaffe attacking several
              targets in Poland. The Luftwaffe launches air attacks against
              Krakow, Lodz and Warsaw. Within five minutes of the Luftwaffe
              attacks, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine orders the old Battleship
              Schleswig-Holstein to open fire on the Polish military transit
              depot at Westerplatte in the Free City of Danzig on the Baltic
              Sea, but the attack is repulsed. By 8:00 a.m., troops of the
              German Army, still without a formal declaration of war issued,
              launch an attack near the Polish town of Mokra. [1] On 3 Sep
              Great Britain and France declared war on Germany. [2]
            The Republic of China and the Empire of Japan are involved in
              the early stages of the third year of armed conflict between
              them during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The war is in what
              will be known as the "Second Period", which starts in October
              1938 and ends in December 1941. This conflict will eventually
              be swept up into World War II when Japan joins the Axis and
              China joins the Allies. [1]
            Norway and Switzerland declare their neutrality. [1]

            The Wound Badge for Wehrmacht, SS, Kriegsmarine, and Luftwaffe
              soldiers is instituted. The final version of the Iron Cross
              is also instituted on this date. [1]
            Switzerland mobilizes its forces and the Swiss Parliament
              elects Henri Guisan to head the Swiss Armed Forces (an event
              that can happen only during war or mobilization). [1]

            Following the start of the invasion of Poland the previous day,
              the Free City of Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland) is annexed by Nazi
              Germany. Resistors entrenched in the city's Polish Post Office
              are overwhelmed. Danzig yields to Berlin as the capital. [1]
 3 Sep 1939 At 11:15 a.m. British Standard Time (BST), British Prime Minister
              Neville Chamberlain announces on BBC Radio that the deadline of
              the final British ultimatum for the withdrawal of German troops
              from Poland expired at 11:00am and that "consequently this
              nation is at war with Germany". The Parliaments of Australia
              and New Zealand and the Viceroy of India, also declared war
              on Germany within hours of Britain's declaration. [1]
            At 12:30pm BST the French Government delivers a similar final
              ultimatum; which expires at 3:00pm BST. [1]

              pocket-battleship Admiral Scheer anchored off Wilhelmshaven at
              the western end of the Kiel Canal. Several aircraft are lost in
              the attack and, although the German vessel is hit three times,
              all of the bombs fail to explode. [1]
            Japan announces its neutrality in the European situation. The
              British Admiralty announces the beginning of a naval blockade

              the British were soon forced to withdraw from the town. By the

              surrendered in four days, after massive German attacks on

              installations. Britain's preparedness, combined with the valor of
              its pilots and a new weapon called "radar," forced the Germans
              to pay a heavy price for their bombing. By the end of October,
              when the winter weather made the threat of invasion unlikely,
              the Germans had lost 2,375 planes, compared to 800 British
              planes lost. [2]

              and attack the Italians in Albania, overruning one-quarter of
              the country. [2]
            The British launched an air attack on the Italian harbor at
              Taranto from the aircraft carrier "Illustrious." On the night
              of 11 Nov, 21 British "swordfish" attacked the Italian fleet
              in Cavour, and badly damaged the "Littorio" and the "Caio
              Duilono." [2]
            British troops launched a surprise attack on Italian troops
              which occupied parts of western Egypt. The British routed
              the Italians. On 5 Jan the Italian garrison at Bardia - with
              25,000 troops - surrendered. By the end of January, the British
              captured Tobruk and, in early February, captured Bengasi and
              liberated Ethiopia. In April, German reinforcements, under
              the command of General Rommel, arrived in Africa and stopped
              the British advance. The British were forced to withdraw. [2]

       1941 Lend-Lease Passed - With the war going badly for the British,
              it was clear that Great Britain would require assistance from
              the United States. The British were running out of money to pay
              for the arms they were buying. President Roosevelt, therefore,
              went before the country in a "Fireside Chat," in which he called
              for America to become an "arsenal of Democracy." Roosevelt
              then introduced a bill to Congress on 8 Jan 1941 providing
              the President with the power to lend military equipment to
              countries that the President believed were in need. The bill
              passed the House 260 to 165, and the Senate 60 to 31, with
              votes split primarily on party lines. By the end of the war the
              United States had provided the following aid: Great Britain,
              $31 billion; Soviet Union, $11 billion; France, $3 billion;
              China, $1.5 billion; Other European, $500 million; South America,
              $400 million; The amount totaled: $48,601,365,000 [2]
            Battle Of Matapan - The British fleet met the Italian fleet
              at the battle off of Cape Matapan. The Italian Force was led
              by Vice Admiral Angelo Iachino, the British force was led by
              Admiral Cunningham. The British force included the battleships
              Warspite, Valiant and Barham. It also included the carrier
              Formidable. Cunnigham cruisers engaged part of the Italian
              force on 28 Mar. In the meantime, Cunningham's main force
              was closing. When the British aircraft attacked, the Italians
              changed course and began to withdraw. Cunningham then launched
              successive air attacks against the Italian fleet. The Vittorio
              Veneto was hit and forced to slow down, but was soon making
              20 knots. The cruiser Pola was seriously damaged, and two
              other cruisers and four destroyers were detached to escort
              the Pola. Cunningham's main force of battleships then struck
              the Italian cruiser in the middle of the night. Within three
              minutes, the Italian cruisers Zara and Fiume were sunk. The
              destroyers Affieri and Carducci soon followed. Finally, the
              partially disabled cruiser Pola was boarded and captured. It
              was the greatest British naval victory since Trafalgar. [2]
            German Forces Invade Greece and Yugoslavia - The Germans
              invaded Yugoslavia, after a coup in Belgrade that overthrew
              the pro-German government and replaced it with one committed to
              neutrality. At the same time, the Germans invaded Greece. German
              troops reached Athens by 27 Apr. Britain was able to send 48,000
              of the 60,000 members of its expeditionary force to Greece. [2]
            Germans Attack Crete - German paratroopers invaded Crete and
              were able to rout British forces on the island. [2]
            The German battleship "Bismark" was sunk by the British Navy. In
              the first round of the fight, the British lost the battleship
              "Hood" and suffered the crippling of the battleship "Prince
              of Wales." A second British task force caught up with the
              "Bismark." On 26 May a plane from the "Ark Royal" attacked
              the "Bismark." A torpedo hit its rudder and disabled the
              steering. That night, battleships "Rodney" and "King George"
              attacked the "Bismark" with their big guns. Together with
              torpedos from the "Dorsetshire," they sank the "Bismark." [2]
            German forces invaded Russia. The Germans advanced on a 2,000
              mile-long front. Together with their allies, they were able to
              mass 3 million troops. Initially, the Russians had 2 million
              troops. German troops advanced along the whole front. By
              September, they began laying seige to Lenningrad, and then
              captured Kiev. By the end of October, the Germans had reached
              Crimea in the south and Moscow's suburbs in the north. [2]
            Atlantic Charter - President Roosevelt and Prime Minister
              Churchill spent three days meeting together on board their ships
              at Argentina Bay, Newfoundland. The two leaders developed a close
              personal friendship, probably the closest between a President
              and any foreign leader up to that time. While the President
              was meeting with Churchill, the American military staff, led
              by George Marshall, was meeting with the British military,
              discussing aid, as well as joint actions that could be taken. [2]
            Pearl Harbor - The American decision to impose sanctions on
              Japan, in response to the Japanese invasion of Indo-China,
              convinced Japanese leaders that war with the United States
              was inevitable. While the Japanese continued to negotiate in
              Washington, plans went ahead for military action. The Japanese
              were convinced that they could not win a war of attrition
              with the United States, so they planned a surprise attack on
              Pearl Harbor, hoping that a decisive victory would be achieved,
              which would force the United States to negotiate. The Japanese
              attack was executed with precision and, despite having broken
              the Japanese code, the Americans at Pearl Harbor were caught

       1942 Singapore Surrenders - The British fortress at Singapore was
              forced to surrender to the Japanese. The Japanese advanced down
              through the Malayan pennisula. They crossed onto the island of
              Singapore on the night of 7 Feb and forced the more numerous
              British troops to surrender. [2]
            A series of battles make up what is called the Battle of
              Java Sea. In the first engagement, on 4 Feb, the US cruiser
              Marblehead was attacked from the air repeatedly. Though damaged,
              the Marblehead managed to limp back to the United States. The
              cruiser Houston was also hit, and had its aft 8 inch guns
              knocked out. On 27 Feb an Allied task force, led by Dutch
              Rear Admiral Karel Doorman, sailed to attack the enemy east
              of Baewen. The force included the Dutch flagship De Ruyter,
              the British cruiser Exeter, the USS Houston, the Australian
              cruiser Perth and the Dutch cruiser Java. The battle began
              at 1616, with Japanese heavy cruisers under the command of
              Vice-Admiral Takagi Takeo opening fire on the Houston and
              the Exeter. Following this, the light cruiser Jintsu led a
              group of destroyers in an attack on British destroyers. Three
              British destroyers went down. A general engagement then ensued
              between the Allied and Japanese cruisers. When it was over,
              the Dutch cruisers De Rutyer and Java were sunk, and the Perth
              and Houston were forced to withdraw. The USS Langley, the first
              US carrier, had been converted to a seaplane tender. Along with
              the freighter Seawitch, the Langley sailed to Java with its
              cargo, planes and pilots. Unfortunately, on 27 Feb, they were
              spotted by Japanese reconnaissance planes. Land-based Japanese
              planes then attacked, and the Langley was so damaged it had to
              be abandoned. The next day, the Houston and Perth attempted to
              attack Japanese ships unloading at Banten Bay. They sunk four
              of them, but then were caught by a large force of Japanese
              warships. Both Allied warships went down. The same day, the
              Exeter, the last cruiser of the Allied forces in the area,
              was sunk by Japanese forces in the Sunda Strait. [2]
            American bombers, under the command of General Doolittle, scored
              a major psychological victory when they bombed Japan. Only
              minor damage was inflicted by the forces of medium bombers
              that were specially modified to be launched from carriers. [2]
            Battle of the Coral Sea - The Japanese were advancing toward
              Australia, with the intention of assaulting Port Moseby. US
              task forces engaged a Japanese force in the Coral Sea. It was
              the first battle in which two naval forces engaged without ever
              coming within shooting distance of each other. Japanese planes
              managed to sink the American carrier Lexington and damage the
              Yorktown. The Americans sank a Japanese light-carrier and put
              two Japanese cruisers out of commission. The Japanese advance
              was halted. [2]
            The Japanese caught the bulk of the American air force assigned
              to protect the Philippines on the ground, despite the fact that
              the Japanese attack took place many hours after the attack on
              Pearl Harbor. On 22 Dec 1941, 100,000 Japanese troops landed on
              the island of Luzon. Japanese forces converged on the capital
              of Manila, forcing the defenders to retreat to the Bataan
              Peninsula and eventually to the island of Corregidor. There,
              on 6 May, American forces surrendered. [2]
            The British launched a 1,000-plane night raid on Cologne. This
              raid was just one of many night raids visited on German
              cities. [2]
            Battle of Midway - The Japanese planned to attack the island of
              Midway, expanding their hold on the Central Pacific. American
              intelligence intercepted Japanese plans and knew of the
              impending Japanese attack. The Americans sent their entire
              carrier force, including the recently damaged "Yorktown,"
              to intercept the Japanese force. The Americans succeeded in
              sinking four Japanese carriers, losing only the "Yorktown." This
              was the turning point in the Pacific War. [2]
            The first American offensive of the war was the landing on
              Guadalcanal. The subsequent attempt to hold the island resulted
              in a number of sea battles with the Japanese. The first was
              the Battle of Savo Island, on 9 Aug 1942. The Japanese, led
              by Admiral Mikawa, sent a task force of five heavy cruisers,
              two light cruisers and a destroyer to attack the American
              forces off the island. The Allies dispatched five heavy
              cruisers and a destroyer to guard the cruiser. The American
              forces were divided into two groups, and totally unaware of
              the approach of the Japanese ships. The battle began when
              Japanese float planes flying unmolested above the American
              cruisers released flares. Within moments, Japanese guns had set
              the HMAS Canberra on fire. Moments later, the USS Chicago was
              similarly enveloped. Soon the Japanese turned their attention
              to the northern group, and the Astoria, Quincy and Vincensses
              were soon out of action and ablaze. Thus, in the worse surface
              warfare defeat in US Navy history, the Americans and Australians
              lost five cruisers without inflicting significant casualties
              on the enemy. [2]
            The Japanese decided to launch a major reinforcement of
              Guadalcanal, and sent three carriers, battleships, numerous
              cruisers and destroyers to support reinforcements. The American
              carriers were sent to block the move. On 24 Aug the Ryujo, an
              escort carrier which was being used as bait ahead of the main
              carrier force, was spotted, and the Enterprise and Saratoga
              launched aircraft to attack it. By the time the main enemy
              force had been spotted, it was impossible to contact the
              planes that had been sent to attack the decoy. The aircraft
              went on to sink the Ryujo. The main Japanese carrier force
              then attacked the Enterprise, which was hit, but whose damaged
              was controlled. Pilots from the Saratoga responded and sank
              a Japanese seaplane tender. [2]
            German troops reached the Russian city of Stalingrad, on the
              Volga, and laid seige to it. German troops advanced on Stalingrad
              and broke through Russian lines, but did not succeed in taking
              the city. Hitler would allow no withdrawal from Stalingrad,
              and the Russian troops gradually wore down the Germans. [2]
            The US force of two heavy and two light cruisers and five
              destroyers attacked the Tokyo Express in an attempt to reinforce
              Guadalcanal. In the battle, the US force bested the Japanese
              one, sinking one destroyer and one cruiser and heavily damaging
              a second cruiser. [2]
            German forces, under the command of Rommel, met the British
              forces, under the command of General Montgomery at El
              Alamein. Montgomery had a two-to-one advantage in tanks,
              and was victorious. The victory in El Alamain eliminated the
              German threat to the Suez Canal and the Middle East. [2]
            The invasion of North Africa, in what was named "Operation
              Torch," was designed to encircle German troops stationed
              there. American troops went ashore in French North Africa
              with limited opposition. Soon after the landings, French
              troops defected to the American side. American and British
              troops advanced towards Tunisia, where they met stiff German
              opposition. [2]

              east of Lavallette on a bright moonlit night. The explosion
              and "spectacular, towering fire" was so great that it could be
              seen from shore, and the Shark River Lifeboat Station (NJ) was
              the first to report the incident. Only two men survived. The
              following morning, the World War I-era destroyer USS Jacob

              vessels after the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, institutes

              vessels outside of protected harbors are placed in anchorages
              protected by netting after dark, and move only under whatever
              escort is available during the day. As word of this and
              similar measures reaches Dönitz, he does not wait to test
              their effectiveness, but instead shifts his U-boats to the
              area controlled by the Gulf Sea Frontier, where American
              anti-submarine measures are not as effective. As a result,
              in May more ships will be sunk in the Gulf, many of them off
              the Passes of the Mississippi, than off of the entire Eastern
              Seaboard. [1]
            The Pacific War Council meets for the first time in
              Washington. Intended to allow the smaller powers involved in
              fighting the Japanese to have some input into US decisions,

              of the ABDA Command. [1]

              is directed to seize the Russian oil fields in the Caucasus;
              a secondary thrust is to capture Stalingrad and protect the
              flank of the main advance. [1]
            The Imperial Japanese Navy launches a carrier-based air attack on
              Colombo, Ceylon during the Indian Ocean raid. Port and civilian

              [3] are taken off to detention camps in the north. [1] Thousands
              die or are killed en route. [3] Corregidor, in the middle of
              Manila Bay, remains a final point of resistance. [1]
            An Indian Ocean raid by Japan's 1st Air Fleet sinks the British

              cause the Axis forces in North Africa to be better supplied
              than British forces, sends a telegram to Sir Stafford Cripps
              in Cairo, asking him to pressure General Auchinleck to take

17 Apr 1942 French General Henri Giraud, who was captured in 1940, escapes
              from a castle prison at Konigstein by lowering himself down the
              castle wall and jumping on board a moving train, which takes
              him to the French border. [1] [7] Hitler, outraged, ordered
              Giraud's assassination upon being caught, but the French general
              was able to make it to North Africa via a British submarine. He
              joined the French Free Forces under General Charles de Gaulle
              and eventually helped to rebuild the French army. [7]
18 Apr 1942 Doolittle Raid on Nagoya, Tokyo and Yokohama. Jimmy Doolittle's
              B-25s take off from USS Hornet. The raids are a great boost
              of morale for Americans whose diet has been mostly bad news. [1]
            The Eastern Sea Frontier, the United States Navy operational
              command in charge of the East Coast of the United States,
              somewhat belatedly forces a blackout along the East Coast. This
              deprives U-boat commanders of background illumination,
              but provides only a very little relief from U-boat attack;
              as the nights grow shorter more U-boat attacks are occurring
              in daylight hours. [1]
            Pierre Laval becomes Prime Minister of Vichy France. [1]

              our vital needs, especially flour and ammunition, and that very
              soon...." Churchill concludes from this and other "disturbing
              news" that Dobbie is not capable enough for such an important
              job, and decides to replace him with Lord Gort. [1]
            USS Wasp delivers 47 Spitfire Mk. V fighters of No. 603 Squadron
              RAF to Malta; the planes are destroyed, mostly on the ground,

28 Apr 1942 The bulk of the British assault troops depart Durban in South
              Africa for Madagascar; the slower ships, carrying transport
              and heavy weapons, have departed in great secrecy some days
              earlier. [1]

            Adolf Hitler summons Benito Mussolini and Galeazzo Ciano to a
              summit conference at Salzburg. Like most Hitlerian conferences,
              this one is actually a thinly-disguised attempt to harangue
              the invitees into compliance with the Fuehrer's will; in this
              case, the Italians are to commit more troops to the Eastern
              Front. Hitler is successful, and Mussolini agrees to send
              an additional seven divisions, as well as the two already
              promised. These unfortunate troops will be formed into the
              Eighth Italian Army and attached to von Bock's (later von
              Weichs's) Army Group B. [1]
 1 May 1942 Rommel readies for a new offensive during the early part of
              this month. [1]
            Troops of the Japanese Fifteenth Army under General Shojiro
              Iida take Mandalay and Monywa, securing the western terminus
              of the Burma Road. [1]
 2 May 1942 In response to American intelligence intercepts, which warn
              of the impending Japanese landings, the Australian garrison
              is evacuated from Tulagi. [1]
 3 May 1942 In the initial move of the Japanese strategic plan to capture
              Port Moresby, Japanese forces under Admiral Kiyohide Shima
              make unopposed landings on Tulagi, opening the Battle of the
              Coral Sea. [1]
            American General Joseph Stilwell decides that nothing more
              can be accomplished in Burma, and that the time has come to
              evacuate. [1]
 4 May 1942 US Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's Task Force 17 makes the
              first carrier strike of the Battle of the Coral Sea, attacking
              Japanese naval targets near Tulagi. [1]
            Howell and his party of 114, mostly Americans, begin their
              trek to the Indian border and safety. To reach India, Stilwell
              will not only have to stay ahead of the Japanese, but beat
              the coming monsoon. [1]
 5 May 1942 Heavy Japanese artillery attack on Corregidor. [1]
            British forces begin "Operation Ironclad": the invasion of
              Madagascar to keep the Vichy French territory from falling to
              a possible Japanese invasion. [1]
            The city of Exeter is bombed by the Luftwaffe, another "Baedeker
              Raid". [1]
            In the Coral Sea, both Japanese and American carrier aircraft
              spend this day and the following one searching for each other's
              ships, with no success, even though at one point the opposing
              carrier groups are separated by less than a hundred miles of
              ocean. [1]
            General Stilwell abandons his trucks, which constantly become
              stuck and so are actually impeding progress rather than aiding
              it. He retains his Jeeps, which do better. Late in the day
              his party arrives at Indaw. [1]
            Wartime sugar rationing begins in the United States. [3]
 6 May 1942 On Corregidor, Lt. General Jonathan M. Wainwright surrenders
              the last U.S. forces in the Philippines to Lt. General Masaharu
              Homma. About 12,000 are made prisoners. Homma will soon face
              criticism from his superiors over the amount of time it has taken
              him to reduce the Philippines, and be forced into retirement
              (1943). [1]
            After a pep talk, General Stilwell and his party of 114 set out
              from Indaw on foot, with only 11 Jeeps to carry their supplies
              and any incapacitated, to reach the Indian border. He sends a
              last radio message which ends, "Catastrophe quite possible." The
              radio is then destroyed. [1]
 7 May 1942 Vichy forces surrender Diego Suarez, the most important
              port in Madagascar, to British forces involved in Operation
              Ironclad. However, the Vichy forces are able to withdraw in
              good order. [1]
            In the Coral Sea, Japanese search planes spot refueling ship
              USS Neosho and destroyer USS Sims, which have retired from
              Fletcher's Task Force 17 into what should have been safer
              waters to refuel Sims. They are mistaken for an aircraft
              carrier and a cruiser. Japanese Admiral Takagi, believing he
              has at last found the location of Fletcher's main force, orders
              a full out attack by carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku and sinks
              both ships. This distraction helps prevent the Japanese from
              finding the real location of Fletcher's carriers. Meanwhile,
              Fletcher has a similar false alarm, the spotting of two
              cruisers and two destroyers being mistakenly encrypted as "two
              carriers and four cruisers." By chance, though, planes from
              USS Lexington and USS Yorktown stumble across light carrier
              Shoho while pursuing the false lead and sink her, (the battle
              marks the first time in naval history that two enemy fleets
              fight without visual contact between warring ships) leading to
              the first use in the American Navy of the signal, "Scratch one
              flattop." Admiral Inoue is so alarmed by the loss of Shoho he
              halts the Port Moresby invasion group north of the Louisiades
              until the American carriers can be found and destroyed. [1]
            In Burma, General Stilwell must abandon his Jeeps. From here
              on all in the party will have to march. The fifty-nine-year-old
              General decides a cadence of one hundred five beats per minute
              will best match the disparate abilities of his party, and they
              march fifty minutes and rest ten each hour. [1]
 8 May 1942 In the Coral Sea, each side finally locates the other's main
              carrier groups, consisting of Japanese carriers Shokaku and
              Zuikaku, and American carriers Lexington and Yorktown. Several
              attacks follow. Only Zuikaku escapes unscathed; Shōkaku
              has her flight deck bent, requiring two months' repairs;
              Lexington is sunk and Yorktown damaged. Fletcher retires;
              this action closes the Battle. While arguably a stalemate or
              even tactical victory for the Japanese, who have sunk the most
              tonnage and the only large carrier, the Battle of the Coral Sea
              is usually seen as a strategic victory for the United States,
              as Admiral Inoue cancels the Port Moresby operation, the first
              significant failure of a Japanese strategic operation in the
              Pacific Theatre. In addition, Yorktown will be repaired in
              time to make important contributions at Midway (although she
              will not survive), whereas neither the damaged Shōkaku nor
              Zuikaku (which, although not directly attacked, has suffered
              unsustainable losses in aircraft), will be able to refit
              in time for Midway, giving the Japanese only four operable
              carriers available for that battle. [1]
            Gunners of the Ceylon Garrison Artillery on Horsburgh Island
              in the Cocos Islands rebel in the Cocos Islands Mutiny. Their
              mutiny is crushed and three of them are executed, the only
              British Commonwealth soldiers to be executed for mutiny during
              the Second World War. [1]
            The German 11th Army begins Operation Trappenjagd (Bustard
              Hunt) and destroys the bridgehead of the three Soviet armies
              defending the Kerch Peninsula in the eastern Crimea. [1]
 9 May 1942 On the night of 8/9 May 1942, gunners of the Ceylon
              Garrison Artillery on Horsburgh Island in the Cocos Islands
              rebelled. Their mutiny was crushed and three of them were
              executed, the only British Commonwealth soldiers to be executed
              for mutiny during the Second World War. [1]
            USS Wasp and HMS Eagle deliver a second contingent of Spitfires
              to Malta in Operation Bowery. A few days later, a grateful
              Churchill will signal Wasp "Who says a Wasp can't sting
              twice?" These aircraft, employed more aggressively than those
              previously delivered, turn the tide in the skies over Malta
              during the next few days, and the Axis is forced to abandon
              daylight bombing. This is a major turning point in the Siege,
              and thus in the North African Campaign, although the approaches
              to the island remain subject to deadly and accurate Axis air
              attack, preventing efficient re-supply of the island. [1]
            In Burma, General Stilwell and his party begin crossing the Uyu
              River. Only four small rafts are available, and the crossing
              takes the better part of two days. [1]
            Holocaust: The SS executes 588 Jewish residents of the Podolian
              town of Zinkiv (Khmelnytska oblast, Ukraine). The Zoludek Ghetto
              (in Belarus) is destroyed and all its inhabitants executed or
              deported. [1]
10 May 1942 Unaware that the tide is turning even as he speaks, Kesselring
              informs Hitler that Malta has been neutralized. [1]
            Churchill, growing ever more frustrated with General Auchinleck's
              inactivity, finally sends him a telegram with a clear order;
              attack in time to cover for the Harpoon/Vigorous convoys to
              Malta during the dark of the moon in early June. This places
              Auchinleck in the position of complying or resigning. Auchinleck
              does not immediately reply, leaving Churchill, CIGS, and the
              War Cabinet in a state of suspense. [1]
            The Thai Phayap Army invades the Shan States during the Burma
              Campaign. [1]
12 May 1942 German submarine U-553, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Karl
              Thurmann, sinks British freighter Nicoya near the mouth of
              the St. Lawrence River, signalling the opening of the Battle
              of St. Lawrence. [1]
            Second Battle of Kharkov - In the eastern Ukraine, Soviet forces
              of Marshal Timoshenko's Southwest Theatre of Operations,
              including Gorodnyanski's 6th Army and Kharitonov's 9th
              Army, initiate a major offensive to capture Kharkov from the
              Germans. 9th Army is to attack first, with a primary objective
              of Krasnograd, and a secondary one of Poltava; 6th Army is to
              follow immediately. After 9th Army has captured Krasnograd,
              6th Army is to swing north and link up with 28th Army and
              57th Army, the latter two formations having meanwhile cut the
              railway between Belgorad and Kharkov. [1]
            The 33-page Amerika Bomber trans-Atlantic strategic bomber
              design competition proposal document makes it to Reichsmarschall
              Hermann Goering's offices, with ten copies printed — six of
              these were sent to the Luftwaffe, and four held in reserve. [1]
            The U.S. tanker SS Virginia is torpedoed in the mouth of the
              Mississippi River by the German submarine U-507. [1]
13 May 1942 General Stilwell and his party cross the Chindwin River. They
              are now almost certainly safe from the Japanese, but still
              dependent on their own supplies in a very remote area and
              racing to beat the monsoon. [1]
14 May 1942 In response to the Soviet offensive in the Kharkov area, Hitler
              orders elements of Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII north to do
              ground support missions. As a result, by the end of the day 14
              May, the Germans have established a tentative but increasing
              air superiority over the Kharkov sector. In addition, on this
              day Hitler orders General Kleist, whose command is in positions
              opposite and to the south of the Soviets' left flank, to quickly
              prepare and launch a strong armoured counter-offensive. [1]
            In Burma, General Stilwell and his party begin ascending the Naga
              Hills. They are met at Kawlum by a relief expedition headed by
              British colonial administrator Tim Sharpe. "Food, doctor, ponies,
              and everything," notes a grateful Stilwell in his diary. [1]
15 May 1942 In the United States, a bill creating the Women's Auxiliary
              Army Corps (WAAC) is signed into law. [1] [7]
            General Stilwell crosses the border into India. [1]
16 May 1942 United States 1st Armored Division arrives in Northern
              Ireland. [1]
17 May 1942 In the salient north of Kharkov, Russian 28th and 57th Armies
              are having trouble making progress against General Paulus's
              (German) 6th Army. [1]
            For once, Adolf Hitler has not hobbled his local commander with
              a strict "no retreat" order, and Paulus is free to conduct
              an efficient delaying action. In addition, Paulus' troops
              are largely up to strength and fully equipped as a result
              of preparations for the upcoming drive to Stalingrad. In the
              south salient, Kharitonov's 9th Army has routed the Romanian
              (3rd and/or 4th Army; accounts differ) troops in his path
              and captured Krasnograd, and is proceeding to Poltava;
              Gorodnyanski's 6th Army has made its planned turn to the
              north to link up with 28th and 57th Armies. 9th Army's
              impetus has stretched Kharitonov's armoured units out along
              a seventy-mile track, diluting their strength; and attempts
              to cover his left flank by driving the Germans back from it
              have been unsuccessful. The Russians take only a few prisoners
              along this flank, but Timoshenko is dismayed by the variety of
              units, especially armoured units, this handful of men represent
              (this is because Kleist is concentrating troops in this area
              in preparation for his counter-offensive). Timoshenko loses
              confidence and has his Political Officer Nikita Khrushchev
              ring up the Stavka and ask for permission to halt while he
              secures his left flank; Stavka refuses. [1]
            It has been a week since Churchill sent his ultimatum to
              General Auchinleck, and he has not yet received a reply. He
              sends a terse follow-up: "It is necessary for me to have some
              account of your general intentions in light of our recent
              telegrams." Again there is no immediate reply. [1]
18 May 1942 The Red Army is in a major retreat at Kerch, after large
              numbers surrender. [1]
            In the salient north of Kharkov, the Soviet offensive has
              bogged down. In the southern salient, Kleist has launched
              his counter-offensive. It is immediately successful and by
              the end of the first day the leading elements have reached the
              confluence of the Oksol and Donetz rivers, greatly narrowing the
              base of the salient. In the process the Germans traverse and
              disrupt so many lines of communication that Kharitonov's 9th
              Army begins to lose cohesion as a fighting force, and becomes
              useless as a screen to protect Gorodnyanski's 6th Army which,
              because of its northward progress, is badly disposed to repel
              the German attacks coming from the south. [1]
            The Assam Rifles give General Stilwell's party a formal salute
              in honor of their arrival at Ukhrul, but can offer no motorized
              transport; the nearest road passable by trucks is still a day's
              march away, and there are no Jeeps yet in this part of India. [1]
19 May 1942 At Kharkov, Kleist's counter-offensive continues to prosper;
              and now Paulus launches a second counter-attack from the north,
              designed to link up with Kleist's and encircle as many Soviet
              troops as possible. The Stavka, gradually becoming aware of the
              extent of the danger, orders Gorodnyanski's 6th Army to halt
              their advance. But by now Timoshenko is planning to extricate
              what forces he can before the two German spearheads link up. [1]
            General Stilwell and his party at last reach the truck roadhead
              at Litan; by this time the monsoon rains have started. [1]
            General Auchinleck at last replies to Churchill's somewhat urgent
              telegram of the 10th, saying he will have an attack ready by
              the sailing of the Harpoon/Vigorous convoys for Malta. [1]
            In the aftermath of the Battle of the Coral Sea, Task Force
              16 heads to Pearl Harbor. [1]
20 May 1942 The Japanese conquest of Burma is complete; it is called
              a "military catastrophe". Coincidentally, on this same
              day General Stilwell arrives in Imphal and dismisses his
              evacuation party. All 114 have arrived, although some have to
              be hospitalized due to exhaustion; one of whom, Major Frank
              Merrill, later commander of Merrill's Marauders, is diagnosed
              to have had a mild heart attack en route. [1]
            At Kharkov, as Kleist's and Paulus' forward elements draw
              ever closer together, Timoshenko sends his subordinate General
              Kostenko into the salient to organize a fighting retreat, or,
              failing that, maximize what can be saved. [1]
            Molotov arrives in London, and high-level discussions begin
              the next day. [1]
21 May 1942 Invasion of Malta postponed indefinitely. [1]
            In discussions with Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden, Molotov
              continues to press Soviet demands for territorial acquisitions
              made during the run-up to war, including the Baltic states,
              Eastern Poland, and Bessarabia. Churchill cannot or will not
              agree to these demands, and the talks become deadlocked. [1]
22 May 1942 Mexico declares war on the Axis. [1]
23 May 1942 Kleist's and Paulus' tanks meet up at Balakleya, southeast of
              Kharkov, encircling most of the Soviets' 6th and 9th Armies. [1]
            At the high-level Soviet/United Kingdom talks in London,
              Anthony Eden suggests abandoning attempts to reach territorial
              understandings, and instead conclude a twenty-years'
              alliance. Molotov, whose diplomatic position is weakening
              rapidly as the Soviet military situation deteriorates at Kerch
              and Kharkov, expresses interest. [1]
25 May 1942 In preparation for the next battle, the Japanese naval
              strategists send diversionary forces to the Aleutians. [1]
26 May 1942 The Anglo-Soviet Treaty: their foreign secretaries agree that
              no peace will be signed by one without the approval of the
              other. (An important treaty since Himmler and others will
              attempt to separate the two nations at the end of the war.) [1]
            Rommel begins a Spring offensive at the Gazala line (west of
              Tobruk). It opens with "Rommel's Moonlight Ride," a dramatic
              mechanized dash around 1st Free French Brigade Group positions at
              Bir Hakeim on the British left (desertward) flank, conducted by
              moonlight during the night of 26/27 May. In the process Rommel
              disperses 3rd Indian Motorized Brigade, some six hundred of
              whom are taken prisoner and then released in the desert, and
              who will make their way to Bir Hakeim. The offensive lasts
              well into June and ends with a total victory for Rommel. [1]
            The Free French land on Wallis and Futuna and get rid of the
              pro-Vichy government there. [1]
27 May 1942 Reinhard Heydrich, head of Reich Security, is fatally hurt in
              Prague during Operation Anthropoid by Czechoslovak soldiers;
              he will die on 4 Jun from his wounds. [1]
            British use American Sherman tanks in attempts to stop Rommel's
              attacks on the Gazala line. [1]
            USS Yorktown, damaged at the Coral Sea, limps into Pearl Harbor;
              it is ordered to get repaired and ready as fast as possible
              for the impending battle. [1]
            In occupied Belgium, wearing of the "yellow badge" becomes
              compulsory for Jews. [1]
28 May 1942 In retaliation for the assassination attempt on Reinhard
              Heydrich, Nazis in Czechoslovakia kill over 1,800 people. [1]
29 May 1942 The Jews in France are ordered to wear the yellow Star of
              David. [1] [7]
            Japanese forces have large successes south of Shanghai. [1]
            Rommel turns his troops to Bir Hachim on the south edge of the
              Gazala line; once it is taken, he can move north and destroy
              the Allied emplacements in the line. [1]
30 May 1942 "The Thousand Bomber Raid" on Cologne, revealing new area
              bombing techniques. The raid lasts for 90 minutes. [1]
            USS Yorktown leaves Pearl after hasty repairs and moves to
              join USS Enterprise for the next expected battle. [1]
31 May 1942 Huge German successes around Kharkov, with envelopment of
              several Red Army armies. [1]
            Japanese midget subs enter Sydney harbour and sink one support
              ship; fears of invasion grow. [1]
            So effective has been the use of the Spitfires delivered to
              Malta in Operation Bowery earlier in the month, that Kesselring
              has only eighty-three serviceable aircraft left, as opposed
              to more than four hundred at the peak of Axis air strength
              earlier in the spring. [1]
            Rommel's offensive has stalled out well short of Tobruk,
              due to resistance by British 1st Armoured Division and 7th
              Armoured Division, partially equipped with the new American
              Sherman tanks. He is also confronted by a long supply line,
              which must reach around and is under constant threat from the 1st
              Free French Brigade Group position at Bir Hakeim. He orders two
              lanes cut through the British minefields which run from Gazala
              to Bir Hakeim, on either side of fortified positions held by
              the 150th Brigade of British 50th Infantry Division. He then
              gathers the bulk of his forces near the outlets of these two
              lanes, completing the process on the 31st. These tactics serve
              the triple purpose of shortening his supply line, encircling
              150th Brigade, and allowing him to use the British minefields
              as part of his defences. The area of concentration, promptly
              nicknamed "the Cauldron" by British Command, will be the focus
              of the battle for the next few days. [1]
 1 Jun 1942 First reports in the West that gas is being used to kill the
              Jews sent to "the East". [1]
            To further secure his supply lines, Rommel launches an attack on
              150th Brigade of British 50th Infantry Division, whose position
              he has surrounded. Since he is attacking from the east against
              a position designed to defend against attacks from the west,
              and since there is scant hope of relief, there is little 150th
              Brigade can do and they are soon overwhelmed. [1]
            In a New York Times article, Virginia Farr of West Orange
              (NJ), the only New Jerseyan among twenty-five women serving
              in the British Air Transport Auxiliary, flying Spitfire and
              Hurricane fighter planes from factories to RAF bases around
              the British Isles during World War II, was quoted as saying
              she was "having the time of my life and would not have missed
              it for anything." [10]
 2 Jun 1942 Further heavy bombing of industrial sites in Germany, centred
              mainly on Essen. [1]
 3 Jun 1942 The British coal industry is nationalised. [1]
            Japan launches air raids against Alaska in the Battle of Dutch
              Harbor, beginning the Aleutian Islands Campaign. [1]
            The Battle of Midway opens with ineffective attacks by land-based
              American B-17s on the approaching Japanese fleet. Admiral Nagumo,
              in charge of the Japanese carrier force (Hiryu, Soryu, Akagi
              and Kaga) is unable to locate any American aircraft carriers
              and decides to attack Midway's land-based air defenses the
              first thing the next morning, which in any event is one of
              his planned tasks. [1]
 4 Jun 1942 In the Battle of Midway, the day opens with Admiral Nagumo's
              attack on the air defences of the island. A good deal of damage
              is done and many aircraft destroyed on both sides, but in the
              end the island's airbase is still functional. Nagumo plans a
              second attack on the island, and begins refueling and rearming
              his planes. Meanwhile, attacks are launched from all three
              American aircraft carriers in the area. Planes from USS Hornet,
              Yorktown, and Enterprise all find the targets, although most
              of the planes from Hornet follow an incorrect heading and miss
              this attack. Torpedo Squadron 8 from Hornet breaks and follows
              the correct heading. The Devastators of "Torp 8" are all shot
              down without doing any damage; there is only one survivor,
              George H. Gay, Jr. of Waco, Texas, who watches the battle
              unfold from the water. The torpedo attack fails, but draws
              the Japanese Combat Air Patrol down to low altitude, and they
              are unable to effectively repel the dive bombers from Yorktown
              and Enterprise when they arrive. The bombs find the Japanese
              flight decks crowded with fueling lines and explosive ordnance,
              and Akagi, Kaga, and Soryu are all soon reduced to blazing
              hulks, Akagi hit by only one bomb dropped by Lt. Commander
              Richard Halsey Best; only Hiryu escapes with no hits. Admiral
              Nagumo shifts his flag from Akagi to another ship, the cruiser
              Nagara, and orders attacks on the American carriers, one by a
              group of Aichi D3A dive bombers and a second by Nakajima B5N
              torpedo bombers. The Japanese planes find Yorktown (thinking
              Yorktown already sunk, the second attack group assume it must
              be Enterprise) and damage it so badly that Yorktown must be
              abandoned. Admiral Fetcher shifts his flag to cruiser Astoria
              and cedes operational command to Admiral Spruance. The attacks
              on Yorktown give away Hiryu's continued operations, though,
              and it is promptly attacked and will sink the next day, Admiral
              Yamaguchi choosing to go down with it. Of note, Hiryu and the
              other three destroyed Japanese carriers had participated in
              the attack on Pearl Harbor. [1] The Battle of Midway will be
              Japan's 1st major defeat in WW II. [4]
            Reinhard Heydrich, a key architect of the Holocaust, dies in
              Prague from medical complications that had arisen from injuries
              suffered from an attempted assassination by Czechoslovak
              patriots one week earlier. (Operation Anthropoid) [1]
 5 Jun 1942 At Gazala, British forces of the Eighth Army commanded by
              General Ritchie launch a major counter-attack against Rommel's
              forces in the Cauldron. The attack fails, partly because Rommel
              has already recovered his critical logistics situation and has
              established an excellent defensive position, but also in large
              part due to German anti-tank tactics; 32nd Army Tank Brigade,
              for example, loses 50 of 70 tanks. By early afternoon Rommel
              is clearly in control of the situation and attacks the British
              position known as "Knightsbridge" with the Ariete and 21st Panzer
              divisions. Several British tactical headquarters positions are
              overrun and command and control of the British forces becomes
              problematic; as a result, several brigades are stranded in
              the Cauldron when the British retirement begins. In addition,
              the British suffer further heavy tank losses. [1]
            United States declares war on Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. [1]
 6 Jun 1942 Battle of Midway. U.S. Navy dive bombers sink the Japanese
              cruiser Mikuma and four Japanese carriers. [1]
 7 Jun 1942 Japanese forces invade Attu and Kiska. This is the first
              invasion of American soil in 128 years. Japanese occupation
              of Attu and Kiska begins. [1]
            The Battle of Midway comes to a close; USS Yorktown sinks;
              four Japanese carriers and one cruiser are sunk. The battle
              is viewed as a turning point in the Pacific war. [1]
            The Greek People's Liberation Army makes its first appearance
              at Domnista, where Aris Velouchiotis proclaims the start of
              armed resistance against the Axis. [1]
            The Japanese occupy Atsuta Jima and Narukami Jima from the
              United States. [1]
 8 Jun 1942 Malta receives a squadron of Spitfires. [1]
            The Japanese imperial submarines I-21 and I-24 shell the
              Australian cities of Sydney and Newcastle, but with little
              effect. [1]
10 Jun 1942 Nazis burn the Czech village of Lidice in reprisal for the
              killing of Reinhard Heydrich. [1]
 9 Jun 1942 At Bir Hakeim, Rommel renews his attacks on the 1st Free French
              Brigade's "box." Although the Free French continue to hold out,
              their perimeter, never the largest, is dangerously reduced in
              size, and their position becomes untenable. General Ritchie
              orders 1st Free French Brigade to withdraw the following day. [1]
10 Jun 1942 Nazis burn the Czech village of Lidice as reprisal for the
              killing of Reinhard Heydrich. All male adults and children are
              killed, and all females are taken off to concentration camps. [1]
            Rommel pushes the Free French forces out of Bir Hakeim, a
              fortress south-west of Tobruk. Although the 1st Free French
              brigade is largely surrounded, their commander, General Koenig,
              is able to find and fight his way through gaps in Rommel's
              widely dispersed forces. [1]
11 Jun 1942 Two convoys set out for Malta, one from Gibraltar (code
              named 'Harpoon') and the other from Alexandria (code named
              'Vigorous'), with desperately needed supplies of food, fuel,
              and ammunition. The hope is that the Axis will concentrate
              their attacks on whichever convoy they find first, allowing
              the other one to get through. [1]
            Free French Forces retreat from Bir Hakeim after having
              successfully delayed the Axis advance. [1]
            The United States agrees to send Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet
              Union. [1]
12 Jun 1942 Heavy fighting in Sevastopol with serious losses of life on
              both sides. [1]
            At Gazala, the British are forced out of the defensive position
              known as 'Knightsbridge;' it is only approximately fifteen
              miles from the Tobruk perimeter (some sources give a date of
              13 June for this; the withdrawal may have been in operation
              on both calendar days). [1]
            Anne Frank, a German-born Jewish girl living in Amsterdam,
              received a diary for her 13th birthday, [1] [5] less than a month
              before she and her family went into hiding from the Nazis. [5]
13 Jun 1942 The United States opens its Office of War Information, a centre
              for production of propaganda. [1]
            'Black Saturday' for the 8th Army at the Battle of Gazala;
              during the course of the day Rommel does great damage to
              the British armour. At the end of the day not only have
              unsustainably large amounts of British armour been destroyed,
              but both 50th Division and 1st South African Division, who have
              largely retained their forward positions along the Gazala Line,
              are threatened with envelopment. The position of 50th Division
              is especially grave since Rommel's armour now ranges freely
              between them and safety. [1]
14 Jun 1942 At the Gazala Line, the British position has become untenable,
              and General Auchinleck authorizes General Ritchie to make a
              concerted withdrawal from forward positions along the line. [1]
            1st South African Division is able to withdraw along the coastal
              road, but the road cannot accommodate all the troops at once,
              and this route is in any event is under threat of being cut
              by Rommel's forces; so troops including 50th Division must
              first breakout to the southwest, through the area occupied by
              Italian X Corps, and then turn east to rejoin 8th Army. This
              somewhat daring operation is concluded successfully. The RAF
              forces available, although outnumbered, make a valiant effort
              to cover the retreat. Churchill sends Auchinleck a telegram
              beginning, 'To what position does Ritchie want to withdraw
              the Gazala troops? Presume there is no question in any case
              of giving up Tobruk.' [1]
            The convoy 'Vigorous', en route to Malta, sights a large Italian
              naval squadron headed toward it. 'Harpoon' comes under attack
              for the first time; 'Vigorous' has been under air attack almost
              since leaving port. [1]
            Anne Frank begins her diary [4]
15 Jun 1942 General Auchinleck sends Churchill a reply to the latter's
              telegram of the 14th, saying in part, "...I have no intention
              whatever of giving up Tobruk." [1]
16 Jun 1942 Two convoys moving toward Malta suffer heavy losses; German
              air forces continue to bomb the island itself. Operation
              Harpoon arrives in Malta, but only two of the six supply ships
              survive; one of them has lost part of its cargo due to mine
              damage. The sinking of the tanker Kentucky means that there
              will be precious little aviation fuel added to the dwindling
              RAF stocks on Malta. Late in the day, Operation Vigorous is
              cancelled; the convoy diverts back to Alexandria. [1]
            Churchill, about to leave for America, takes the unusual step of
              sending a letter to King George VI, advising him to make Anthony
              Eden Prime Minister should Churchill not survive the journey. [1]
17 Jun 1942 Tobruk is now surrounded. [1]
18 Jun 1942 Manhattan Project is started, the beginning of a scientific
              approach to nuclear weapons. [1]
            Winston Churchill arrives in Washington for meetings with
              Roosevelt. [1]
            The siege of Tobruk intensifies; some defending forces are
              pulled back to Egypt. [1]
20 Jun 1942 The Holocaust: Kazimierz Piechowski and three others, dressed
              as members of the SS-Totenkopfverbande, steal an SS staff
              car and escape from the Auschwitz concentration camp. [1]
21 Jun 1942 The German Afrika Korps under Rommel [9] recaptures Tobruk,
              [1] [9] with 35,000 men captured; the road to Egypt is now
              open as the British retreat deep into Egypt. Tobruk's loss
              is a grievous blow to British morale. German land forces have
              been assisted by Luftwaffe attacks. [1]
            A Japanese submarine surfaces near the Columbia River in Oregon,
              firing 17 shells at Fort Stevens in one of only a handful of
              attacks by Japan against the United States mainland. [1]
22 Jun 1942 Erwin Rommel is promoted to Field Marshal after the capture
              of Tobruk. [1]
23 Jun 1942 Germany's latest fighter aircraft, a Focke-Wulf Fw 190, is
              captured intact when it mistakenly lands at RAF Pembrey in
              Wales. [1]
24 Jun 1942 General Dwight D. Eisenhower arrives in London ready to assume
              the post of Commander of American forces in Europe. [1]
25 Jun 1942 Another massive British "Thousand Bomber" raid, this time on
              Bremen; the raiders suffer grievous losses. [1]
26 Jun 1942 The Germans drive toward Rostov-on-Don. [1]
27 Jun 1942 Convoy PQ 17 sets sail from Iceland; only 11 of 37 ships will
              survive. [1]
            The FBI announced the capture of eight Nazi saboteurs who had
              been put ashore from 2 submarines, one off New York's Long
              Island and the other off of Florida. The men were tried by a
              military court and 6 were secretly executed in a DC jail. Ernest
              Burger and George Dasch were sentenced to 30 years in prison
              for their help in revealing the plot. They were pardoned in
              1948 by Pres. Truman. [8]
28 Jun 1942 FBI agents and New Jersey state troopers raided Camp Bergwald,
              in Bloomingdale (NJ), arresting several people on suspicion
              of being Nazi sympathizers. The camp, a resort formerly owned
              by the German-American Vocational League, which had formally
              dissolved after Pearl Harbor, had hosted German-American Bund
              activities in the 1930s. [10]
            Case Blue, the German plan to capture Stalingrad and the
              Soviet Union oil fields in the Caucasus, begins. Generally,
              forces are shifted to the South. [1]
            Mersa Matruh, Egypt, about 140 miles from Alexandria, falls
              to Rommel. [1]

 1 Jul 1942 First Battle of El Alamein begins as Rommel begins first
              assault on British defences. [1]
            Sevastopol falls to the Germans; the end of Red Army resistance
              in the Crimea. [1]
 2 Jul 1942 Churchill survives a censure motion in the House of Commons. [1]
 3 Jul 1942 Guadalcanal is now firmly in the hands of the Japanese. [1]

              hiding in [1] [4] After House, [4] the "Secret Annexe" above
              her father's office in an Amsterdam warehouse. [1] Four other
              people later join them. They hide from Nazi occupiers for two
              years before being discovered and arrested. [3]
 7 Jul 1942 German submarine U-701 destroyed off Cape Hatteras. [1]
10 Jul 1942 An American pilot spots a downed, intact Mitsubishi A6M Zero
              on Akutan Island (the "Akutan Zero") that the US Navy uses to
              learn the aircraft's flight characteristics. [1]
            Diplomatic relations between the Netherlands and the Soviet
              Union are established. [1]
11 Jul 1942 Rommel's forces are now stalemated before El Alamein, largely
              because of a lack of ammunition. [1]
12 Jul 1942 It now becomes clear that Stalingrad is the largest challenge
              to the invaders. [1]
            A balloon from Operation Outward knocks out a power station
              near Leipzig. [1]
15 Jul 1942 The only action around El Alamein is light skirmishing. [1]
16 Jul 1942 Vel' d'Hiv Roundup: On order from the Vichy France government
              headed by Pierre Laval, French police officers mass arrest
              13,152 Jews and hold them at the Winter Velodrome before
              deportation to Auschwitz. [1]
18 Jul 1942 During the Beisfjord massacre in Norway, 15 Norwegian

              prisoners from Yugoslavia. [1]
            The Germans test fly the Messerschmitt Me 262 V3 third prototype
              using only its jet engines for the first time. [1]
19 Jul 1942 Battle of the Atlantic: The Second Happy Time of Hitler's
              submarines comes to an end, as German Grand Admiral Karl
              Donitz orders the last U-boats to withdraw from their United
              States Atlantic coast positions in response to an increasingly
              effective American convoy system. [1]
20 Jul 1942 After landing in the Buna-Gona area, the Japanese in New
              Guinea move across the Owen Stanley mountain range aiming at

              British and the Americans to a firm date for the cross-channel
              invasion. The Allies finally committed to May 1944. Stalin,
              in return, committed the Soviets to aiding the Allies against
              Japan once the Nazis were defeated. During the course of the
              conference, Roosevelt put forth to Stalin for the first time
              his ideas of a postwar international organization. Stalin
              agreed in principle. Stalin brought up the proposal to move

       1944 American forces landed at Anzio, just south of Naples,
              in an attempt to out-flank the Germans. German resistance
              was fierce, and there were fears that the beachhead would
              not hold. Determined fighting by American forces ultimately
              secured the beachhead. [2]
            Advancing Russian troops, led by General Vatutin, crossed the
              Polish frontier from the Ukraine. The German forces, which
              were severly depleted, could do little to halt the Soviet
              advance. [2]
            Battle of The Philippine Seas - Nine Japanese carriers,
              accompanied by battleships and cruisers, attempted to attack
              an American force led by 15 carriers, covering the landings
              in Saipan. The battle became known as the "Marina's Turkey
              Shoot." The Japanese started the battle with 430 carrier
              aircraft. When it ended, they had only 35 left. Almost all
              were shot down, by the American fighters and anti-aircraft
              guns, while attempting to attack the US force. In addition,
              two Japanese fleet carriers were sunk by submarines, and one
              by air attack. [2]
            Bretton Woods Conference - The United States was committed to
              establishing a framework for the post-war world that would ensure
              economic development and stability. In Jul 1944 it sponsored
              the U.N. Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods,
              New Hampshire. Forty-four nations attended the Conference. A
              plan was agreed upon to establish an International Monetary
              Fund to help stabilize currencies and promote international
              trade. The delegates also agreed to the establishment of the
              International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which
              later came to be known as the World Bank. [2]
            Southern France Invaded - Allied forces landed in Southern
              France. They met limited opposition and were able to quickly
              capture Toulon and Marseilles. [2]
            Market Garden Fails - After liberating Antwerp and Brussels,
              Belgium, the Allies planned a very ambitious operation to
              capture the bridges over the Rhine. The plan entailed the
              landing of paratroopers at Arnhem Bridge. They were to hold
              the bridge until advancing ground forces could reinforce
              them. The ground forces failed, however, to make the link up,
              and the airborne troops at Arnhem were wiped out. [2]
            Dumbarton-Oaks Conference - This meeting was attended by
              representatives of the US, Great Britain, the Soviet Union
              and China. At the conference, delegates discussed the charter
              of a new, permanent, post-war international organization. The
              conference laid the groundwork for the creation of the United
              Nations. [2]
            attle Of Leyte-Surigao Straits - The last major naval battle
              of the Pacific took place off Leyte after the American landing
              there. The Japanese divided their forces into three groups. The
              first blood was drawn by American submarines Darter and Dace,
              which sank two Japanese cruisers and reported the positions
              of the Japanese ships. An air battle ensued, which resulted
              in the sinking of the light carrier Princeton. The Americans
              sank the super battleship Musashi. The last engagement between
              battleships then began. A Japanese force of two battleships,
              with cruisers and destroyers, attempted to penetrate the Leyte
              Gulf through the Surigao Straits. Awaiting them were two forces
              of destroyers, a force of cruisers and six battleships. In
              one of the most one-sided victories of the American Navy, the
              Japanese ships were hit first by the destroyers, then by the
              cruisers, and then by the battleships, which were all perfectly
              positioned and mostly equipped with advance fire control radar.
              The two Japanese battleships were soon sunk, as well as three
              destroyers. Other than damage to one destroyer, the US force
              suffered no losses. [2]
            Battle Of Leyte-Samar - The second stage of the battle
              occurred when a Japanese force of battleships and cruisers,
              led by Admiral Kurita, came upon a force of escort carriers
              of task force Tafy 3, commanded by Rear Admiral AF Sprague,
              off Samar. The escort carriers were hit repeatedly by the
              guns of the Japanese force. However, daring attacks by three
              American destroyers, as well as desperate attacks by all of
              the carrier planes, succeeded in driving off the superior
              Japanese force. The Americans lost only the escort carriers
              Gambier Bay and St Lo. Two destroyers and a destroyer escort
              that had gallantly attacked the Japanese battleships were also
              lost. The invasion fleet, however, was safe. The final act
              in the battle occurred when US aircraft attacked the Northern
              Japanese force. Three Japanese carriers were sunk, as well as
              a cruiser and destroyer. Most of the remaining vessels were
              heavily damaged. [2]
            The US airforce, flying B-29 bombers - the most powerful planes
              of the war - began strategic bombing raids against Japan. The
              raids, which grew in size, slowly destroyed all of Japan's
              industrial capabilities. [2]
            Battle of the Bulge - The German forces made a surprise attack
              against US forces in Belgium. The Germans made rapid progress,
              but were unable to capture the city of Bastogne, where American
              forces were encircled. The US and the British were able to
              counterattack, and the Germans were forced to withdraw, but
              not before US forces lost 35,000 men. [2]

              of breaking through the Winter Line and seizing Rome, an effort
              that would ultimately take four months and cost 105,000 Allied
              casualties. [1]

22 Jan 1944 Allies begin Operation Shingle, the landing at Anzio, Italy,
              commanded by American Major General John P. Lucas. The Allies
              hope to break the stalemate in south Italy, but they are
              unable to break out of the beachhead and the line holds until
              late May. The minesweeper USS Portent (AM-106), commanded
              by Lt. H.C. Plummer, hit a mine and sank southeast of Anzio,

 4 Feb 1945 Yalta Conference Began - President Roosevelt, Prime Minister
              Churchill, and Marshal Stalin, met [1] [2] [9] at Yalta in the
              Southern Soviet Union. The meeting was a continuation of the
              earlier dialogue between Churchill and Stalin. In that meeting,
              Churchill and Stalin had discussed spheres of influence in
              post-war Europe, and Churchill was reported to have written
              down a list of countries in which he recorded both nations
              and percentages. Accordingly, he wrote down: Romania-90%,
              Soviets-10%, Allied Yugoslavia-50%, Allies-50%. The first
              order of business was a discussion of when the Soviets would
              enter the war against the Japanese. The Soviets agreed to
              enter the war within three months of the end of the war with
              Germany. The Soviets' political demands included the transfer
              of the Kurile Islands to the U.S.S.R., recognition of Soviet
              sovereignty over Outer Mongolia and other concessions. Finally,
              the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a four-power
              trusteeship over Korea. At the conference, Roosevelt agreed
              that the new borders of Poland would be the Curzon line --
              the boundary which had existed at the end of World War I before
              the Russo-Polish war. In return, the Poles would receive land
              from Germany, thus moving the border of Poland westward. One
              of the most significant issues discussed was the rulership of
              Poland. It was agreed that the Soviet puppet-regime, called the
              "Lublin Poles," would initially rule. This agreement called
              for free and democratic elections in Poland. The three parties
              agreed to four-party control of Germany. The major disagreement
              over the operations of the United Nations was resolved, with
              the Soviets agreeing to the American proposal regarding the use
              of the veto in the Security Council. The Soviets requested that
              two of their republics receive separate representation in the
              U.N. The US and the United Kingdom agreed. The Yalta Conference,
              to this day, is seen by many as an example of Western appeasment
              of the Soviets. Others perceive the conference as a reflection of
              the power of Soviet troops advancing on Germany at the time. [2]

              place the toll closer to 70,000. The novel "Slaughterhouse Five"
              by Kurt Vonnegut was set in Dresden during the firebombing
              where he was being held as a prisoner of war. US B-17 bombers
              dropped 771 more tons on Dresden while P-51 Mustang fighters
              strafed roads packed with soldiers and civilians fleeing the
              burning city. In 2006 Marshall De Bruhl authored "Firestorm:

              country to do so; its policies for sheltering escaping Nazis
              are also coming under scrutiny. Argentina had not declared
              war before due to British wishes that Argentine shipping be
              neutral (and therefore Argentine foodstuffs would reach Britain
              unharmed), this, however, went against the plan of the USA,
              who applied much political pressure on Argentina. [1]

              both major branches of Congress. The only purpose of the San
              Francisco Conference was the establishment of a charter for the
