      c1003 Norse captain Leif Ericson is believed to have reached the Island
              of Newfoundland circa 1000 AD. They establish a colony in 1003

              John Cabot lands the Matthew of Bristol somewhere on the
              northern Atlantic coast of North America, claiming the land
              for England by the Doctrine of discovery. The precise location

11 Apr 1713 The Treaty of Utrecht was actually a group of documents. The
              treaties were among several European states, including France,
              Spain, Great Britain, Savoy, and the Dutch Republic, and they
              helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. In North America,
              France ceded to Great Britain its claims to the Hudson's
              Bay Company territories in Rupert's Land, Newfoundland and
              Acadia. France retained its other pre-war North American
              possessions, including Ile-Saint-Jean (now Prince Edward
              Island) as well as Ile Royale (now Cape Breton Island),

            The Indigenous settlement of Kanesatake is founded at the
              confluence of the St.Lawrence and Ottawa rivers. It is founded
              by the Sulpician Order under a royal charter as a home for
              Catholic converts of the Indigenous peoples of the region,
              including the Mohawk. The lands' ownership becomes disputed
              between the Order and the Indigenous residents over the
              original land grant and title. The settlement would later be
              the location of the Oka Crisis. The land remains disputed. [1]

21 Jun 1749 Halifax, Nova Scotia, is founded [1] [3] and settled by the
              British, marking the first time that public rather than private
              capital was used to settle a British colony in the Americas. The
              Indigenous Mi'kmaq consider Britain's unilateral action as a
              violation of treaties signed after Father Rale's War in 1726,
              starting Father Le Loutre's War. British colonists would
              drive French and Mi'kmaq inhabitants from peninsular Nova
              Scotia but are repelled from Acadian settlements further north
              (present-day New Brunswick). [1]

            First settlers at Greenwich [now in Kings County, Nova
              Scotia]. [5]
10 Feb 1763 The Treaty of Paris ended the French and Indian War/Seven Years'
              War. It was signed by Great Britain, France and Spain, with
              Portugal in agreement. Preferring to keep Guadeloupe, France
              gave up Canada to Britain. [1]
 7 Oct 1763 By the Royal Proclamation of 1763, King George III of Great
              Britain created the Province of Quebec in the St. Lawrence
              valley, the part of the former French province of Canada
              that was settled by people of French descent. The Great Lakes
              basin was barred to European settlement, reserved as exclusive
              "hunting grounds" for the "several nations or tribes of
              Indians" under the king's "protection." [1]
       1764 Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada founded. [1]
            Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada founded. [1]
       1766 Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada founded. [1]
       1768 Beloeil, Quebec, Canada founded. [1]
            L'Acadie, Quebec, Canada founded. [1]
            Saint-Eustache, Quebec, Canada founded. [1]
14 Jul 1769 St. John's Island is partitioned from Nova Scotia, becoming
              a separate colony from the mainland. The colony is renamed
              Prince Edward Island in 1798. [1]
       1774 By the Quebec Act, the territory of the Province of Quebec was
              expanded to take over part of the Indian Reserve, including
              much of what is now southern Ontario, Illinois, Indiana,
              Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota. [1]
       1783 Kingston, Ontario, Canada founded. Formerly known as Fort
              Frontenac. In 1673, the original fort was built and called
              Fort Cataraqui. It was later renamed Fort Frontenac. It was
              abandoned and razed in 1689, then rebuilt in 1695. [1]
       1784 Cornwall, Ontario, Canada founded by a group of United Empire
              Loyalists led by Lieutenant-Colonel John Johnson. [1]
22 May 1784 Over 3,000,000 acres (1,200,000 ha) of land is purchased by
              the British Crown from the Mississaugas of the Credit First
              Nation in present-day Ontario for £1180.00. [1]
18 Jun 1784 New Brunswick and Cape Breton Island are partitioned from Nova
              Scotia, becoming separate colonies. Cape Breton re-joins Nova
              Scotia in 1820. [1]
25 Oct 1784 Under the terms of the Haldimand Proclamation, 550,000 acres
              (220,000 ha) of the lands purchased from the Mississaugas
              is granted to the Mohawks and the other Five Nations of the
              Haudenosaunee Confederacy. The land is a tract extending 6
              miles (9.7 km) on either side of the Grand River from source
              to mouth. However, it is later determined that the head of
              the Grand River was outside of the lands purchased from the
              Mississaugas. In 1792, Governor Simcoe unilaterally reduces
              the land grant to 270,000 acres (110,000 ha). Later land sales,
              government actions, and the creation of the Six Nations of the
              Grand River reserve would reduce the lands under Indigenous
              possession to a small fraction of the original grant. The land
              grant and its management is the basis of the Grand River land
              dispute between the Six Nations and Canada. [1]
       1785 Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada founded. [1]
            Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada founded. [1]
       1789 Santa Cruz de Nuca, British Columbia, Canada founded (only
              Spanish settlement in Canada). [1]
26 Dec 1791 The Province of Quebec was divided into two parts, Lower
              Canada and Upper Canada. The Province of Upper Canada (French:
              province du Haut-Canada) was a British colony located in what
              is now the southern portion of the Province of Ontario in
              Canada. Upper Canada officially existed from 26 December 1791
              to 10 February 1841. Its name reflected its position higher up
              the river or closer to the headwaters of the St. Lawrence River
              than that of Lower Canada, present-day southern Quebec. The
              division was effected so that Loyalist American settlers and
              British immigrants in Upper Canada could have English laws and
              institutions, and the French-speaking population of Lower Canada
              could maintain French civil law and the Catholic religion. [1]

              Montreal to James Bay and a second expedition by sea. In
              September 1803, the overland party met the company's ship at
              Charlton Island in what is now Nunavut. There, they lay claim
              to the territory that drained into the Arctic in the name of
              the North West Company. [1]
       1807 Prince George, British Columbia, Canada founded, expanded from
              the fur-trading post of Fort George, established by the North
              West Company. [1]
       1811 Settlement began of the Red River Colony, a 300,000 square
              kilometres (120,000 sq mi; five times that of Scotland) area,
              by Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk via a land grant from
              the Hudson's Bay Company, of which he was a part-owner. The
              territory later became part of Manitoba and the Missouri
              Territory. [1]
       1812 Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada founded, expanded from the
              fur-trading posts of Fort Cumcloups (Fort Kamloops) and Fort
              She-whaps (Shuswap), founded by the Pacific Fur and North
              West Companies. [1]

              the fur-trading post of Fort Alexandria, founded by the North
              West Company. [1]
   Jul 1821 The North West Company of Montreal and the Hudson's Bay Company
              merged, with a combined territory that was further extended
              by a license to the watershed of the Arctic Ocean on the north
              and the Pacific Ocean on the west. [1]

10 Feb 1841 The Province of Canada or the United Province of Canada was
              created by combining Lower Canada and Upper Canada. It was
              a British colony in North America from 1841 to 1867. Its
              formation reflected recommendations made by John Lambton,
              1st Earl of Durham in the Report on the Affairs of British
              North America following the Rebellions of 1837. The Province
              of Canada ceased to exist at Canadian Confederation on 1 Jul
              1867, when it was redivided into the modern Canadian provinces
              of Ontario and Quebec. [1]

              of £600. [1]
       1852 The United Kingdom moves the capital of the Crown Colony of

              Peninsula (Bruce Peninsula) in Canada West in exchange for
              reserves and interest on the sale of the surrendered lands. [1]
       1856 The United Kingdom moves the capital of the Crown Colony of

            Windsor, Ontario, Canada becomes a town. [1]
            New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada founded. [1]
 2 Aug 1858 The continental portion of Canada's part of Oregon Country
              organized as the Colony of British Columbia. [1]
       1859 A boundary commission was set up to delineate the border between
              Vancouver Island and the Washington State coast. The commission
              could not come to agreement on where the middle of the Strait
              was so in 1859 things came to a head during the bloodless Pig
              War. [1]
            The United Kingdom moves the capital of the Crown Colony of
              the United Province of Canada from the city of Quebec back to
              Toronto. [1]
       1862 Victoria, British Columbia, Canada incorporated. [1]
            Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada founded, originally known
              as Isbister's Settlement. [1]
       1866 The United Kingdom moves the capital of the Crown Colony of
              the United Province of Canada from the city of Quebec to
              Ottawa. [1]

              form United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia.
              [1]
       1867 Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada founded, originally known
              as Gastown. [1]
 1 Jul 1867 The United Kingdom unites its colonies of New Brunswick,
              Nova Scotia, and the Crown Colony of the United Province of
              Canada [1] as the Dominion of Canada. [1] [2] Ottawa is the
              capital. Sir John A. Macdonald is sworn in as the first Prime
              Minister of Canada. This date is commemorated annually in
              Canada as Canada Day, a national holiday. [1]
 9 Apr 1869 Hudson Bay Company cedes its territory to Canada. [3]
27 Jan 1870 Manitoba & Northwest Territories incorporated. [3]
15 Jul 1870 The United Kingdom ceded most of its remaining land in North
              America to Canada, with Rupert's Land and the North-Western
              Territory becoming the North-West Territories. The Rupert's
              Land Act 1868 transferred the region to Canada as of 1869,
              but it was only consummated in 1870 when [pounds]300,000 were
              paid to the Hudson's Bay Company. At this time, the Manitoba
              Act took effect, and a small square of the newly acquired
              region surrounding the city of Winnipeg was made the province
              of Manitoba. [1]
            The actual border between Newfoundland & Quebec is still
              unknown. Mapmakers have mostly made their own guesses until
              1927, pretending that the border was more known than it really
              was. The problem didn't stop in 1927. [1]
20 Jul 1871 The Crown Colony of British Columbia joins the Dominion of Canada
              as the sixth province. British Columbia joined the Canadian
              confederation following The Great Confederation Debates in
              the spring of 1870 and the Confederation Negotiations of the
              following summer and winter. [1]
 3 Aug 1871 Treaty 1 is signed between the Chippewa and Swampy Cree First
              Nations and the Crown surrendering lands in Manitoba. [1]
21 Aug 1871 Treaty 2 is signed between the Chippewa Cree First Nation and
              the Crown surrendering lands in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. [1]
       1873 Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada founded; formerly known as Fort Rouge
              (built in 1738, abandoned by 1749). [1]
 1 Jul 1873 The British colony of Prince Edward Island joined Canada as the
              seventh province by an Act of Parliament (and, as part of the
              terms of union, was guaranteed a ferry link, a term which was
              deleted upon completion of the Confederation Bridge in 1997). [1]
 3 Oct 1873 Treaty 3 is signed between the Ojibwe First Nations and the
              Canadian Crown, surrendering lands in Northwestern Ontario
              (present-day) and Manitoba. [1]
26 Jul 1874 The borders of Ontario were provisionally expanded north and
              west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were
              not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed to eventually reach all
              the way to the Rocky Mountains and Arctic Ocean. With Canada's
              acquisition of Rupert's Land, Ontario was interested in clearly
              defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas
              it was interested in were rapidly growing. After the federal
              government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new
              disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its
              limits, and its boundary was moved north to the 51st parallel
              north. [1]
15 Sep 1874 Treaty 4 is signed between the Cree First Nations and the Crown
              of Canada, surrendering lands in present-day Saskatchewan,
              Alberta and Manitoba. [1]
20 Sep 1875 Treaty 5 is signed between the Saulteaux and Swampy Cree First
              Nations and the Canadian Crown, surrendering lands in Manitoba,
              Saskatchewan and Ontario. [1]
12 Apr 1876 The District of Keewatin was created by the passage of the
              Keewatin Act in a central separate strip from the North-West
              Territories, in order to provide government for the growing
              area north of Manitoba and west of Ontario. [1]
   Aug 1876 -Sep 1876, Treaty 6 is signed between the Plain and Wood Cree
              First Nations and the Canadian Crown, surrendering lands in
              present-day Alberta and Saskatchewan. [1]
 7 Oct 1876 The District of Keewatin was created from a central strip of
              the North-West Territories to provide government for the
              growing area north of Manitoba and west of Ontario; while
              the North-West Territories consisted of several districts,
              Keewatin had an elevated status and many sources note it
              distinct from the rest of the North-West Territories. [1]
22 Sep 1877 Treaty 7 is signed by the Nakoda and Blackfoot First Nations and
              the Canadian Crown, surrendering lands in southern present-day
              Alberta. [1]
 1 Sep 1880 The United Kingdom ceded its Arctic Islands to Canada, and
              they were made part of the North-West Territories. [1]
       1881 Brandon, Manitoba, Canada founded. [1]
 1 Jul 1881 Manitoba's borders were expanded to a larger postage stamp
              province taking land easterly from the District of Keewatin to
              the western boundary of Ontario. Since the province's eastern
              border was defined as the "western boundary of Ontario", the
              exact definition of which was still unclear, Ontario disputed
              a portion of the new region. [1]
23 Dec 1881 Manitoba was expanded, gaining land from the District of Keewatin
              and North-West Territories to the west, north, and east. Since
              the province's new eastern border was defined as the "western
              boundary of Ontario", the exact definition of which was still
              unclear, Ontario disputed a portion of the new region. [1]
       1882 Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada founded. [1]
            Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada settled. [1]
       1883 Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada founded. [1]
            Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada settled. [1]
       1884 Calgary, Alberta, Canada founded; formerly known as Fort Calgary
              (in 1875, Fort Brisebois was established, renamed Fort Calgary
              in Jun 1876). [1]
       1886 Nelson, British Columbia, Canada founded. [1]
 7 May 1886 The southwestern border of the District of Keewatin was adjusted
              to conform to the boundaries of the new provisional districts of
              the North-West Territories created in 1882, returning some land
              to the North-West Territories. The provisional districts were
              the District of Alberta, the District of Athabasca, District
              of Assiniboia and the District of Saskatchewan, which all
              remained administrative areas of the North-West Territories,
              unlike the District of Keewatin. [1]
 6 Apr 1886 The City of Vancouver, Canada was incorporated. The population
              of the city was about 1,000. [4]
12 Aug 1889 The dispute between Manitoba and Ontario ended as Ontario's
              borders were finalized in accordance with the Canada (Ontario
              Boundary) Act, 1889, which extended the province west to the
              Lake of the Woods and north to the Albany River. [1]
       1890 Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada founded, formerly known as Fort
              Whoop-Up. [1]
       1892 Edmonton, Alberta, Canada founded, formerly known as Fort
              Edmonton. [1]
            Windsor, Ontario, Canada becomes a city. [1]
            Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada settled. [1]
       1893 Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada founded. [1]
       1894 Yorkton, Saskatchewan, Canada founded. [1]
 2 Oct 1895 Keewatin covered the portion of the North-West Territories north
              of Manitoba on the mainland, and all islands within Hudson,
              James, and Ungava Bays. The portion between the District of
              Keewatin, Ontario, and Hudson Bay was not in a district, and was
              assigned to the District of Keewatin by an Order of Council. Four
              additional provisional districts of the North-West Territories
              were formed, the District of Yukon, the District of Ungava,
              the District of Mackenzie, and the District of Franklin. [1]
       1896 Dawson City, Yukon, Canada founded, capital of the Yukon
              Territory until 1952. [1]
18 Dec 1897 Southampton Island, Coats Island, Akimiski Island, and other
              islands were transferred from the North-West Territories to the
              District of Keewatin, and the Boothia Peninsula and Melville
              Peninsula were transferred from the District of Keewatin to
              the North-West Territories. [1]
13 Jun 1898 Yukon Territory was created from the District of Yukon in
              the northwestern part of the North-West Territories, and the
              Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898 expanded the borders of
              Quebec north to the Eastmain River. [1]
       1899 Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada incorporated as a village. [1]
 8 Jul 1899 Treaty 8 is signed by the Cree, Beaver, Chipewyan First Nations
              and the Canadian Crown, surrendering 840,000 square kilometres
              (320,000 sq mi) of lands in present-day British Columbia,
              Alberta and Saskatchewan. [1]
23 May 1901 The eastern border of Yukon Territory was adjusted to the
              eastern edge of the Peel River watershed, and also to include
              some more islands. [1]
       1903 Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada incorporated as a city. [1]
21 Sep 1903 Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada became a village. [1]
       1905 Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada founded. [1]
 1 Sep 1905 The provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created from
              the North-West Territories. Saskatchewan's western border and
              Alberta's eastern border run concurrent with the 4th meridian
              or the 110 degrees W longitude. Saskatchewan's eastern border
              is not a meridian, but instead follows a staircase-shaped
              Dominion Land Survey range line. Alberta's southern and northern
              borders are the same as Saskatchewan's: the southern border
              is the Canada-United States border or the 49th parallel and
              the northern border is the 60th parallel. Alberta's western
              border runs along peaks of the Rocky Mountain ridge and then
              extends north to the 60th parallel. The District of Keewatin
              became an administrative unit of the Northwest Territories. [1]
       1906 The North-West Territories were renamed the Northwest
              Territories. [1]
            Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada became a town. [1]
            North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada founded. [1]
28 Aug 1906 Treaty 10 is signed between several First Nations, including
              the Cree and Chipewyan, and the Crown, surrendering 220,000
              square kilometres (85,000 sq mi) in northern Saskatchewan
              and Alberta. Additional nations signed on later in 1906 and
              1907. [1]
15 Mar 1907 Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada became a town when the
              population reached 550 people. [1]
26 Sep 1907 The Dominion of Newfoundland was a British dominion from 1907
              (before which the territory had the status of a British colony,
              self-governing from 1855) to 1949. The Dominion of Newfoundland
              was situated in northeastern North America along the Atlantic
              coast and comprised the island of Newfoundland and Labrador on
              the mainland. Newfoundland never became independent according to
              the modern meaning of the word. The Statute of Westminster 1931
              would have made Newfoundland much closer to being independent,
              but not completely. However, the government of Newfoundland
              did not ratify it, and furthermore, abolished itself in 1934
              because of bankruptcy. [1]
11 Apr 1908 A boundary treaty redefined the maritime border with the United
              States. Among other changes, this "de-enclaved" Horseshoe
              Reef in Lake Erie by making the water around it contiguous
              with the water on the American side of the border. [1]
       1911 The Pas, Manitoba, Canada founded, expanded from Fort
              Paskoyac. [1]
15 May 1912 Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec were all expanded into their
              present-day boundaries. The Northwest Territories is now only
              situated north of the 60th parallel (except Hudson Bay and
              James Bay islands) with three districts, Keewatin, Mackenzie
              and Franklin. [1]
       1915 Prince George, British Columbia, Canada founded, expanded from
              Fort George. [1]
 1 Jun 1925 The maritime boundaries of the Northwest Territories were
              extended to the North Pole. [1]
11 Mar 1927 A decision of the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council
              of 1927 decided the issue of the border between the Dominion
              of Newfoundland and Canada in favour of Newfoundland. The issue
              had been the precise boundary between the Canadian province of
              Quebec and Labrador, part of Newfoundland. The boundary ruling
              clarified that a large area of the disputed land belonged
              to Newfoundland, not to Canada. Maps prior to 1927 wildly
              disagreed on the actual position of the border, instead of
              agreeing upon marking the area as being disputed. Maps after
              1927 tended to agree with the decision, but due to protests,
              some mapmakers in Quebec still disagreed. In the 60's, logos
              of the two biggest political parties of Quebec (PLQ & UN)
              both included the shape of the province as including all of
              Labrador. Disagreements persist even today (to a lesser extent),
              as Quebec insists on including the rest of the gulf's basin
              in its maps, separated with a dotted line saying 1927 border,
              non-final. Newfoundland complains in 2014, even though older
              electoral maps showed the same. [1]
11 Nov 1930 Sverdrup Islands are ceded to Canada by Norway, in exchange for
              British recognition of Norway's sovereignty over Jan Mayen. [1]
 7 Feb 1931 Statute of Westminster 1931 allows dominions to become
              independent. Dominion of Canada decides to become almost
              independent, whereas Newfoundland does not sign. [1]
11 Dec 1931 By the Statute of Westminster 1931, Canada gains full control
              over its foreign policy and thus independence from the United
              Kingdom. Ottawa remains the capital. [1]
       1934 The Dominion of Newfoundland, because of financial difficulties,
              was obliged to give up its self-governing status and the
              Commission of Government took its place. [1]
       1934 Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada founded. [1]
       1942 Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada founded. [1]
       1948 Air Force Island, Prince Charles Island, and Foley Island are
              discovered and added to Northwest Territories. [1]
31 Mar 1949 The Dominion of Newfoundland and its dependency of Labrador
              joined Canada as the tenth province, named Newfoundland as
              proclaimed by the British North America Act 1949. St. John's
              yields to Ottawa as the capital. [1]
       1950 Alert, Nunavut, Canada founded, world's northernmost
              permanently-inhabited place. [1]
       1956 Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada founded [1]
       1973 Galt, Ontario, Canada, the towns of Preston and Hespeler,
              the village of Blair and parts of Waterloo township merged
              to form Cambridge. [1]
13 Mar 1974 The maritime border with Denmark was defined, notably "skipping"
              Hans Island which lies directly between Ellesmere Island and
              Greenland, and which was technically on neither side of the
              border. [1]
17 Apr 1982 Canada becomes a fully sovereign, independent state from the
              United Kingdom after the passing of the Canada Act. Ottawa
              remains the capital. [1]
 1 Apr 1999 The Canadian territory of Nunavut was created from the
              Northwest Territories. The provisional districts are no longer
              administrative areas of the Northwest Territories. [1]
       2001 Lachenaie, Quebec, Canada merged with Terrebonne. [1]
            L'Acadie, Quebec, Canada merged with Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. [1]
 6 Dec 2001 The province of Newfoundland was renamed Newfoundland and
              Labrador. [1]
       2002 Charlesbourg, Quebec, Canada becomes a borough of Quebec City. [1]
            Lachine, Quebec, Canada merged into Montreal. [1]
            Gatineau, Quebec, Canada formed by merging five cities. [1]
 1 Apr 2003 Yukon Territory was renamed Yukon, though it remained a
              territory. [1]
27 Nov 2006 The House of Commons of Canada approves a motion introduced
              by Prime Minister Stephen Harper recognizing the Quebecois
              as a nation within Canada. [1]
14 Jun 2022 An agreement to redefine the maritime border with Denmark was
              announced, so that it passes through Hans Island rather than
              skipping over it. [1]
