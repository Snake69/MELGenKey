From "Fare To Midlands:  Forgotten Towns Of Central New Jersey" by Henry
Charlton Beck in 1939:

Amwell Township and Hopewell Township acquired their names (according to
Susan Weart) when ...

BEGIN

David [Stout] used to come down from his house [in what is now Amwell
Township] and Jonathan from his [in what is now Hopewell Township].
They'd meet, usually, at the crossroads, within hearing of everybody.
Their greeting was always the same.  Jonathan would greet his brother with,
"I hope you are well, David!"  And David would reply, blusteringly, as
if some doubt of it had been implied, "I am well, Jonathan!"  So, before
there was either Hopewell or Amwell, their neighbors called them Amwell
David and Hopewell Jonathan!
