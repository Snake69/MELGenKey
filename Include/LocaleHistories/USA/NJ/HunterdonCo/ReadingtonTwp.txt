History of Readington Township, Hunterdon Co.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
July 15, 1730 was the official birth date of Readington Township. Created by
Royal Charter as Readings, or Readings Town, it wasn't until 1798 that it
became Readington Township. Containing about 48 square miles, ours is the
largest Township in the County of Hunterdon and one of the largest in the
State of New Jersey. We are bounded on the north by the Rockaway Creek and
the Lamington River, southerly by the south branch of the Raritan River,
easterly by Somerset County and westerly by the "Society's Great Tract"
of some 92,000 acres of land owned by the proprietors of West Jersey. Our
westerly border was the crest of Cushetunk Mountains and up the middle of
Potterstown Road. This line was surveyed in 1711.

Our heritage is Dutch-German with the Dutch being the earliest and most
populous. Original settlements of Dutch farmers took place in and around
the Village of Readington, where a mill was erected (circa 1710 - 1715) by
Adrian Lane. By 1738 the Dutch Reformed Church of North Branch moved west
to Readington, no doubt because of the greater number of members residing
there. Today's Readington Dutch Reformed Church replaces two earlier church
buildings. As the population increased, a school was built; an inn and a
store completed the Little Dutch Settlement. Readington Village is listed
on the National Register of Historic Places. Remaining are five eighteenth
century houses, a portion of the mill wall, the store, church and cemetery,
inn, two school houses and several early nineteenth century houses.

White House (inclusive of White House Station which came into being when the
railroad came through in 1847) and Potterstown are also ancient communities.
White House got its name from the Inn of Abraham Van Horne who came here
in 1733. Van Horne's Inn was located along an important Indian path and was
the only place of rest for travelers for many miles. The building had white
walls and eventually became know as "the White House". The whole area took
its name from the little pre-Revolutionary tavern.

Potterstown, another village on the National Register of Historic Places,
competed with Readington for early settlers. It is in this tiny village that
the "Society's Line" crosses the important Raritan Indian Path. We know that
Potterstown was a stopover for travelers early in the eighteenth century.
This village appears on every map of ancient New Jersey. There were two
taverns, a blacksmith shop, a store house and wheelwright and at sometime
in the long distant past, a pottery. Owners of property included some of
the most famous names in New Jersey history; William Alexander (The Lord
Stirling of Revolutionary fame), John Stevens and Robert Livingston. The
first German Lutheran Church building erected in the State of New Jersey was
built here in 1729/1730 on land donated by a free black man named Aray Van
Guinee. At his time in history of New Jersey, Aray Van Guinee was probably
the most prominent black in the whole state. His sons went on to fight
in the Revolutionary War. At the far end of Potterstown, up the Rockaway
Creek, is the mill of Colonel John Taylor, commanding officer of the 4th
Hunterdon Militia. The miller's house stands, too. Both were built in 1760
and both are on the National Register of Historic Places. Grain for the use
of the Revolutionary Army was ground in this little mill. Our roots go deep
in Potterstown.

Did you know that Stanton was first called Housel's, then Waggoner's Hill,
then Mount Pleasant and finally when the post office was established and
there was another Mt. Pleasant in Hunterdon, Stanton. Also on the National
Register of Historic Places, Stanton was originally a settlement of German
farmers stretched along the "Society's Line" on large land holdings.
Intermarriage with Dutch families and the fact that the nearest Lutheran
Church had relocated to New Germantown (known as Oldwick today) made
everyone Dutch. With Readington "Meeting House" also a great distance, a
new Dutch Reformed Church was opened here in 1833. There had been a school
in Stanton since the late eighteenth century and a store opened in 1838.
Remaining are three stone houses built in the mid-eighteenth century,
a clapboard house vintage 1789, several early nineteenth century houses,
a store, a church and many barns to remind us that everyone was once a farmer.

Tucked way over in the most southerly corner of the Township are Three Bridges
and Centerville, both located on the Old York Road. During, and before,
the Revolutionary War, Old York Road was one of the most important roads in
the Colonies. You see, it connected the great cities of Philadelphia and New
York. As the Swift Sure Stage Coach jolted and banged over this mud path on
its way to the city, there was a place, a small inn, where an overnight stop
was necessary for horse and passenger alike. The center point on the trip,
it soon took on the name of "Centerville" and has kept it to this day. Just
south on the road is another small town, Three Bridges. When the railroad
went through the area in 1867, the town grew into a charming place filled
with late nineteenth century homes.

While these quaint villages are scattered throughout the Readington Township
today, they were once small centers of church, school and commerce in a vast
farming Township. Loosely connecting these places were tiny hamlets bearing
such names a Mechanicsville, Dreahook, Lewisburg, Farmersville, Stillwells
- all descriptive of who lived and worked there, all have disappeared down
the dusty paths of time. Readington's historical roots are deeply entwined
in the families that began this nation.
