Project Title
-------------

\
MEL Genealogy Key (or MELGenKey)\
v20250926\
An aid for genealogists. A \"full stack\" application written in
JavaScript, HTML and CSS.\
\
\
\

Project Description
-------------------

\
MELGenKey is a menu-based application offering many functions useful to
a genealogist including database management, creation of HTML versions
of a DataBase & Web sites, search aid (records and data),
verify/inspect/analyze data, reports, auto-updating of MELGenKey Family
DataBases and various on-line DataBases/Trees, and many other
functions.\
\
MELGenKey should run on Microsoft Windows, MacOS and/or Linux as is.\
\
\
\

Technologies Used
-----------------

\
MELGenKey is written in vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks have been
used. External libraries have been used only when necessary.\
\
\
\

Requirements
------------

\
browser (tested with Firefox, Chromium, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi)\
Note - using Brave, if node/server not recognized or not connected, in
Brave go to Settings -\> Shields and disable \"Trackers & ads
blocking\"\
platform (developed on Linux, tested on Linux & Windows)\
node.js (using v20.11.1 during development)\
external libraries: fs-extra (v10.0.1), websocket (v1.0.34),
node-schedule (v2.1.1), nodemailer (v6.9.15) and fuse (v6.6.2)\
\
\
\

Project Objectives
------------------

\
1. Run as is on Linux, Apple or Windows.\
2. Provide all functions useful to genealogists in one place.\
3. Ability to sync trees on host machine, any other host machines
running MELGenSys and utilizing the same tree, and any public tree sites
(e.g., WikiTree.com, Ancestry.com, FamilySearch.org, etc).\
4. Every data item in the database must be sourced/cited.\
5. Simple to use for everyone, including computer-challenged users.\
6. Always Open Source.\
\
\
\

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

\
Install nodejs on your computer if not already installed. Download the
MELGenKey zip file. Ensure the MELGenKey zip file is in your home
directory. Extract the MELGenKey zip file. Navigate into the new
directory/folder created from the extraction (this is the MELGenKey
root directory/folder). While in the MELGenKey root directory/folder,
type \"npm install\" (without the quotes) and press RETURN. At this
point everything should be installed.\
\
To run, while still in the MELGenKey root directory/folder, type \"node
./MELGenKeySS.js\" (without the quotes) and press RETURN. This starts the
server portion of MELGenKey. To start the client, double-click on the
icon labeled \"MELGenKey.html\". Or, in the address line of your browser
of choice enter the proper address to access \"MELGenKey.html\".\
\
For perhaps a more complete MELGenKey installation guide, see the file
\"Overview.html\" in the \"Docs\" directory/folder.\
\
A test DataBase is included with the project. Create an empty
directory/folder, likely in your home directory. Navigate into the Notes
directory/folder located in the MELGenKey root directory (where
MELGenKey is installed). Copy the file \"TestDB-26Sep2025.zip\" into the
empty directory/folder just created. Navigate into this
directory/folder. Unzip \"TestDB-26Sep2025.zip\". Delete
\"TestDB-26Sep2025.zip\". Execute the MELGenKey server. Execute the
MELGenKey client. In the main menu of the client, click \"Import, Create
or Remove a Family DataBase\". In the next menu, click \"Import a Family
DataBase from User Created Files\". On the ensuing form, enter the
location of the directory/folder containing the files to import. This
would be the name of the directory/folder which houses the files unzipped
from \"TestDB-26Sep2025.zip\". (Note - If the directory/folder was created
in your home directory, just entering the name of the directory/folder is
enough. If the directory/folder was created someplace else, then enter
the full path to the directory/folder. In the form, enter a name to
assign to the Family DataBase \... maybe \"TestDB\". After completing
the form, click \"Import DB\". The DataBase should import successfully
with no fatal errors.\
\
\
\

Usage Instructions
------------------

\
Usage instructions are fairly self-explanatory after loading the
application. Each function is described in full in the menu function
\"Help/Info/Docs -\> Using MELGenKey\" (click the button labeled
\"Help/Info/Docs\" in the main menu, then click the button labeled
\"Using MELGenKey\" in the menu which follows). For some basic \"getting
started\" instructions see \"Help/Info/Docs -\> MELGenKey Frequently
Asked Questions\".\

Project Roadmap
---------------

\
MELGenKey is a work-in-progress and not all menu functions are available
with the current version (v20250926). As new functions become available
and/or improvements are made to the application new versions of
MELGenKey will become available.\

Acknowledgments
---------------

\
Even though I\'ve been the only developer on this project (so far), I
consider it very much a community project. I\'ve received inspiration
from many that will go unnamed, all the people that I have exchanged
info with over the years, all the people I\'ve read from and listened to
over the years, all the genealogy-related groups I\'ve been involved in
over the years - I\'ve gotten ideas and inspiration from all of them.
They are all a part of this project.\
