<h2>Project Title</h2>
<br>
MEL Genealogy Key (or MELGenKey)<br>
v20250926<br>
An aid for genealogists. A "full stack" application written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<br>
MELGenKey is a menu-based application offering many functions useful to a genealogist including database management, creation of HTML
versions of a DataBase & Web sites, search aid (records and data), verify/inspect/analyze data, reports, auto-updating of
MELGenKey Family DataBases and various on-line DataBases/Trees, and many other functions.<br>
<br>
MELGenKey should run on Microsoft Windows, MacOS and/or Linux as is.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<br>
MELGenKey is written in vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks have been used. External libraries have been used only when necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<br>
browser (tested with Firefox, Chromium, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi)<br>
  Note - using Brave, if node/server not recognized or not connected, in Brave go to Settings -> Shields and disable "Trackers & ads blocking"<br>
platform (developed on Linux, tested on Linux & Windows)<br>
node.js (using v20.11.1 during development)<br>
external libraries: fs-extra (v10.0.1), websocket (v1.0.34), node-schedule (v2.1.1), nodemailer (v6.9.15) and fuse (v6.6.2)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<br>
1.  Run as is on Linux, Apple or Windows.<br>
2.  Provide all functions useful to genealogists in one place.<br>
3.  Ability to sync trees on host machine, any other host machines running MELGenSys and utilizing the same tree, and any public tree sites (e.g., WikiTree.com, Ancestry.com, FamilySearch.org, etc).<br>
4.  Every data item in the database must be sourced/cited.<br>
5.  Simple to use for everyone, including computer-challenged users.<br>
6.  Always Open Source.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
<br>
Install nodejs on your computer if not already installed. Download the MELGenKey zip file from https://github.com/Snake69/MELGenKey. Ensure the
downloaded zip file is in your home directory. Extract the MELGenKey zip file. Navigate into the new directory/folder created from the extraction
(this is the MELGenKey root directory/folder). While in the MELGenKey root directory/folder, type "npm install" (without the quotes) and press RETURN.
At this point everything should be installed.<br>
<br>
To run, while still in the MELGenKey root directory/folder, type "node ./MELGenKeySS.js" (without the quotes) and press RETURN. This starts the
server portion of MELGenKey. To start the client, double-click on the icon labeled "MELGenKey.html". Or, in the address line of your browser
of choice enter the proper address to access "MELGenKey.html".<br>
<br>
For perhaps a more complete MELGenKey installation guide, see the file "Overview.html" in the "Docs" directory/folder.<br>
<br>
A test DataBase is included with the project. Create an empty directory/folder, likely in your home directory. Navigate into the Notes
directory/folder located in the MELGenKey root directory (where MELGenKey is installed). Copy the file "TestDB-26Sep2025.zip" into the empty
directory/folder just created. Navigate into this directory/folder. Unzip "TestDB-26Sep2025.zip". Delete "TestDB-26Sep2025.zip". Execute the
MELGenKey server. Execute the MELGenKey client. In the main menu of the client, click "Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase". In the next
menu, click "Import a Family DataBase from User Created Files". On the ensuing form, enter the location of the directory/folder containing the files
to import. This would be the name of the directory/folder which houses the files unzipped from "TestDB-26Sep2025.zip". (Note - If the directory/folder
was created in your home directory, just entering the name of the directory/folder is enough. If the directory/folder was created someplace else, then
enter the full path to the directory/folder.) In the form, enter a name to assign to the Family DataBase ... maybe "TestDB". After completing
the form, click "Import DB". The DataBase should import successfully with no fatal errors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
<br>
Usage instructions are fairly self-explanatory after loading the application. Each function is described in full in the menu function
"Help/Info/Docs -> Using MELGenKey" (click the button labeled "Help/Info/Docs" in the main menu, then click the button labeled
"Using MELGenKey" in the menu which follows). For some basic "getting started" instructions see
"Help/Info/Docs -> MELGenKey Frequently Asked Questions".<br>
<br>

<br>
<h2>Project Roadmap</h2>
<br>
MELGenKey is a work-in-progress and not all menu functions are available with the current version (v20250926). As new functions become available
and/or improvements are made to the application new versions of MELGenKey will become available.<br>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<br>
Even though I've been the only developer on this project (so far), I consider it very much a community project. I've received inspiration
from many that will go unnamed, all the people that I have exchanged info with over the years, all the people I've read from and listened
to over the years, all the genealogy-related groups I've been involved in over the years - I've gotten ideas and inspiration from all of
them. They are all a part of this project.<br>
<br>
Shout out to stackoverflow.com as an aid in learning JavaScript and for helping solve problems along the way.<br>
<br>
ChatGPT and Gemini have also provided assistance.<br>
