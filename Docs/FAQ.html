           click the button labeled "Continue" to start the HTML creation process
           error messages and/or informational messages may be displayed or referenced; any "fatal" errors need to be fixed before the
             HTML version of the Family DataBase can be successfully created; there may also be "non-fatal" errors which do not stop the
             HTML version of the Family DataBase from being created

               if you still need more help, click "Help/Info/Docs" on the Main Menu, then click "Contact Developer of MELGenKey via email"

</pre>
<li>View HTML version of the Family DataBase -</li>
<pre>
           click "Display Family Data" on the Main Menu
           click "HTML Family Data"
           a list of files and/or directories/folders will be shown on the screen
             included in the list should be one or more "body.html" files with an included sequential number, a tableofcontents.html file,
               and an index.html file if it exists
             click on tableofcontents.html to see an abbreviated description of the files in the list
             the "body.html" files contain the Family History; the larger the sequential number, the more distant (time-wise) the people in that
               particular file
             the index.html file contains an index of people contained in the "body.html" files

           NOTE - there are many "links" in the HTML version of the Family DataBase; this means that, for example, you may click on the
                  index.html file (if it exists) and then jump to a particular person in the Family DataBase by clicking on a reference
                  associated with the person's name in the index.html file (a person may have multiple references in the index.html file);
                  another example is clicking on a Father or Mother of an individual will jump to the parents' Family Group in the Family
                  DataBase, continuing to click on the Father or Mother in the parents' Family Group will eventually jump back to the most
                  distant ancestor in that line
