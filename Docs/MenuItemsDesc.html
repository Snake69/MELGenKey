<hr style="width:50%">
<br>

<a id="item1.1">"Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase"</a> -<br>
Use this menu item to import or deport a Family DataBase, or to create a HTML version of the active Family DataBase. A maximum of 20 Family
DataBases may be imported. A DataBase can be created and imported from a GEDCOM file or from plain text files (which can be created
by hand). If creating plain text files by hand, see "Help/Info/Docs -&gt; Data Format and Notes" for formatting rules and other notes
pertaining to the plain text files. Limited verification of the DataBase will be done when it is imported. Full verification of the DataBase
can be done by clicking the "Verify Family Data" menu item. Full verification of a DataBase must be done before all the functions are made
available to it.<br>
<br>
After a Family DataBase is created and imported, changes may be made by hand to the active Family DataBase by selecting the
"Edit Family Data" menu item. Re-verification of the DataBase will be done automatically upon completion of the changes.
If a HTML version of the Family DataBase exists, the HTML version will need to be re-created after any changes are made to the
DataBase. Do not make changes directly by hand to the HTML version of the Family DataBase. The HTML version should always be
auto-created from the plain text version using "Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase -&gt; Create HTML Version of Family DataBase".<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item1.2">"Import a Family DataBase from a GEDCOM"</a> -<br>
Select this menu item if a GEDCOM file is to be imported as a Family DataBase.<br>
<br>
In the form enter the location of the GEDCOM file to import. The location may be a full path or a relative path, or, if a name is entered without
any path criteria then the location will be assumed to be within the user's home directory. This is a required entry, and the location must be
a directory/folder (which contains the GEDCOM file). Other files (all optional) besides the GEDCOM file may be part of the import. All the
optional files must be located in the same directory/folder as the GEDCOM file. See "Help/Info/Docs -&gt; Data Format and Notes" for a
description of the layout of the contents of the import directory/folder and other notes pertaining to the optional files.<br>
<br>
If the path is relative, it should be relative to the location of MELGenKey. The location of MELGenKey can be noted via
"Miscellaneous Functions -> Display Info for MELGenKey".<br>
<br>
Enter a name to assign to the Family DataBase. This is a required entry. Enter something which is meaningful. The name must be unique meaning it
cannot be used by a Family DataBase which is already imported.<br>
<br>
Check whether the Family DataBase should be Writeable/Updateable or not. If the Family DataBase is not made Writeable/Updateable it will
not be able to be modified via the "Edit Family Data" menu item. This setting can be changed in
"Miscellaneous Functions -&gt; Write-protection for a DataBase".<br>
<br>
Check whether or not the Family DataBase will be made active upon successful import. This Family DataBase can also be made active (or
deactivated) using the menu item "Family DataBase Activation" on the Main Menu.<br>
<br>
Identify with which individual in the GEDCOM the Family DataBase is to begin. Either enter the ID of the individual within the
GEDCOM or get a list of all eligible individuals in the GEDCOM and select from that. (If selecting from a list, that list will be presented
after clicking the "Import GEDCOM" button.) It is advisable, but not required, to select an individual from the most recent generation in
the GEDCOM (oftentimes this might be yourself).<br>
<br>
Note that the individual identified as starting the MELGenKey Family DataBase is not [necessarily] the same as the Focus ID. After importing
the Gedcom, set the Focus ID via "Miscellaneous Functions -&gt; Set Focus ID for Active DataBase".<br>
<br>
The individual starting the MELGenKey Family DataBase will be assigned the ID of 1.0, the smallest ID appearing in any MELGenKey Family
DataBase. (However, if the selected starting individual is not imported for whatever reason ... usually because of the lack of sources ...
then the next generation will start the MELGenKey Family DataBase with an ID other than 1.0.) This means that if the individual starting the
MELGenKey Family DataBase has children who have their own families, their family groups will not appear in the MELGenKey Family DataBase. If
this is not what is intended, instead select a child (who has his or her own family) as the individual starting the MELGenKey Family DataBase.<br>
<br>
Also note that only the ancestors and their families of the starting individual will be included in the MELGenKey DataBase. If the Gedcom
contains separate unconnected family lines, you may import the same Gedcom again while using an individual from another unconnected family
line as the starting individual. This will create another MELGenKey Family DataBase.<br>
<br>
Check if the import directory/folder (identified at the top of the form) should be removed (along with all it's contents) after the import.
This will happen only if the import is successful.<br>
<br>
After entering all the form data, click "Import GEDCOM". You will be alerted if there are any fatal errors stopping the DataBase from
being imported. If everything is okay, there will be an opportunity to continue or not.<br>
<br>
Note that different programs produce GEDCOMs differently. Some programs produce GEDCOMs which contain records that do not adhere to the
GEDCOM guidelines. And some programs produce records which have their own proprietory extensions. MELGenKey will not pick up data that does
not adhere to the official GEDCOM specifications.<br>
<br>
Also, MELGenKey will not pick up events or items which are not sourced.<br>
<br>
NOTE - In this version of MELGenKey, non-simple Gedcoms may not be processed as you would expect (i.e., the Gedcom import function is not
totally completed).<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item1.3">"Import a Family DataBase from User Created Files"</a> -<br>
Select this menu item if user created files (not a Gedcom) are to be imported as a Family DataBase. The user created files may be created by hand.
See "Help/Info/Docs -&gt; Data Format and Notes" for formatting guidelines, a description of the layout of the contents of the import
directory/folder, and other notes pertaining to the user created files. It may be wondered why anyone would ever create data by hand to be
imported when it might be easier just to create a GEDCOM and import that. For one, I think there are people who don't use GEDCOMs for whatever
reason. But, I think the most likely example might be a person wants to use functions provided by MELGenKey on just one family. It's a
simple process to create the files by hand for one family as opposed to creating a GEDCOM for that one family.<br>
<br>
In the form enter the location of the files to import. This is a required entry, and the location must be a directory/folder (which
contains all the files to import). The location may be a full path or a relative path, or, if a name is entered without any path criteria
then the location will be assumed to be within the user's home directory.<br>
<br>
If the path is relative, it should be relative to the location of MELGenKey. The location of MELGenKey can be seen via
"Miscellaneous Functions -> Display Info for MELGenKey".<br>
<br>
Enter a name to assign to the Family DataBase. This is a required entry. Enter something which is meaningful. The name must be unique meaning
it cannot be used by a Family DataBase which is already imported.<br>
<br>
Enter a focus ID in the DataBase (oftentimes this might be yourself). This is an optional entry. This entry can also be modified using
"Miscellaneous Functions -&gt; Set Focus ID for Active DataBase" after the DataBase is imported and made active. If an ID is entered,
it will be useful for certain functions. Note that the ID for any person in the DataBase may be entered here.<br>
<br>
Check whether the Family DataBase should be Writeable/Updateable or not. If the DataBase is not Writeable/Updateable it will not be able to be
modified via the "Edit Family Data" menu item. This setting can be changed in "Miscellaneous Functions -&gt; Write-protection for
a DataBase".<br>
<br>
Check whether or not the Family DataBase will be made active upon successful import. This DataBase can also be made active (or deactivated)
using the menu item "Family DataBase Activation" on the Main Menu.<br>
<br>
Check if the import directory/folder (identified at the top of the form) should be removed (along with all it's contents) after the import.
This will happen only if the import is successful.<br>
<br>
After entering all the form data click "Import DB". An alert will be issued if there are any fatal errors stopping the DataBase from being
imported. If everything is okay, there will be an opportunity to continue or not.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item1.4">"Create HTML Version of Family DataBase"</a> -<br>
Create a HTML version of the currently active Family DataBase. A HTML version is easier for viewing and traversing on a computer. If the
Plain Text version of the data is changed in any way then the HTML version will need to be re-created. Do NOT edit the HTML version directly
by hand. Always use this menu item to create the HTML version of the Family DataBase.<br>
<br>
The Family DataBase must be successfully verified before the HTML version of the DataBase can be created. To verify a Family DataBase click
"Verify Family Data" from the main menu.<br>
<br>
Upon selecting this function there will be some information presented on the screen. Click on the "Continue" button to proceed with creating
the HTML version of the active Family DataBase. Some checks will be performed and any errors will be shown. Any errors will need to be corrected
before the HTML version of the active Family DataBase can be created. If there are no errors, additional information will be presented along
with a chance to Cancel or Continue. If creating the HTML version of the active Family DataBase ends successfully, then
"Display Family Data -&gt; HTML Family Data" may be used to view the HTML version of the active Family DataBase.<br>
<br>
NOTE - For an email address or a Web link to be wrapped in HTML (i.e., made clickable), the email address or the Web link must be enclosed
within &lt;&gt; in the Plain Text version of the Family DataBase. For example, &lt;joe@bogus.com&gt; or &lt;findagrave.com&gt;.<br>
<br>
The HTML version of the Family DataBase can be used as a Web page. To do this, select "Miscellaneous Functions -> Copy Active DataBase"
and copy the Entire active Family DataBase. After a successful copy, navigate to the directory/folder where the copied Family DataBase is
located. The directories/folders named HTML, Reference and Images (and their contents) are what can be used as a Web page. Copy, move or
upload these directories/folders and their contents to the Web server. After performing the copy/move/upload, create a link on the Web page
called "index.html" (without the quotes). The link should be redirected to "HTML" (without the quotes).<br>
<br>
A Web page may also be created by using "Miscellaneous Functions -> Publish".<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item1.5">"Deport a Family DataBase"</a> -<br>
Select this menu item to deport (remove) a Family DataBase. The DataBase will be auto-backed up before it is removed.<br>
<br>
Note - This function is not yet available.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item1.6">"Re-Import a Deported Family DataBase"</a> -<br>
Select this menu item to re-import a previously deported Family DataBase.<br>
<br>
Note - This function is not yet available.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
<a id="item2.1">"Verify Family Data"</a> -<br>
Use this function to verify a Family DataBase. Formatting and data integrity (so that it meets MELGenKey's specifications) will be verified.<br>
<br>
A Family DataBase must pass verification before it can be fully used by MELGenKey.<br>
<br>
Verification is necessary in order to avoid unspecified results in later processing. Many menu items will not be available until the Family
DataBase passes verification.<br>
<br>
The verification report may be printed either by using the browser built-in print function or by clicking the Print button at the bottom
of the report. In the latter case, a maximum line character length may be specified. In the former case, any lines longer than the width of
the printer carriage will auto-wrap and appear as "run on" lines. In the latter case, lines will not be output longer than the specified maximum
and continuation lines will be indented appropriately which may make the report appear more presentable.<br>
<br>
Note - Any time verification is done, whether it is successful or unsuccessful, if a HTML version of the DataBase exists it will be deleted.<br>
<br>
Note - The verification report may also be saved to a PDF file using the browser built-in print function.<br>
<br>
Note - "Verify Family Data", "Search/Inspect/Analyze Family Data -&gt; Inspect" and "Search/Inspect/Analyze Family Data -&gt; Analyze"
are similar functions in that they all validate the data in some regard. "Verify Family Data" verifies the data so that it conforms
to the format necessary for MELGenKey to perform actions upon it. "Search/Inspect/Analyze Family Data -&gt; Inspect" inspects the data for
errors such as a person being married before they were born. "Search/Inspect/Analyze Family Data -&gt; Analyze" analyzes the data in
a deep manner that may advance research. Examples are analyzing children for naming patterns and looking on-line for helpful info.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
<a id="item3.1">"Family DataBase Activation"</a> -<br>
Use this menu item to select the Family DataBase to be active. (Only one Family DataBase may be active at any one time.) Also, the
active DataBase may be deactivated here. The system will remember which Family DataBase was currently active (if any) when quitting
MELGenKey, and will activate the same DataBase the next time MELGenKey is executed. The "memory" process can be circumvented in
"Miscellaneous Functions -> General User Preferences".<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
<a id="item4.1">"Display Family Data"</a> -<br>
The plain text version or the HTML version (if created) of the active Family DataBase can be displayed. If no Family DataBase is active this
button will be disabled.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item4.2">"HTML Family Data"</a> -<br>
Display the HTML version of the currently active Family DataBase (if already created via
"Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase -&gt; Create HTML Version of Family DataBase"). If no Family DataBase is active
this button will be disabled.<br>
<br>
Upon clicking this button, the Table of Contents for the HTML version of the active Family DataBase will be displayed. Any of the entries
in the Table of Contents may be clicked to display that particular data. The "body" files contain the family history. The smaller the number
portion of the "body" filename, the more recent the people contained in that file. If trying to locate a particular person, clicking on the
index (if available) may be the best thing to do. You may move around in the data by clicking on clickable areas just like would be done on a
Web page on the World Wide Web. Use the browser Print facility to print a portion of the family data to hard copy or to a file. Also, for
sharing smaller batches of data, the "Cut &amp; Paste" interprocess communication technique may be available. Copy text by highlighting it
with the mouse pointer, and then paste it into another program (e.g., a text editor or the body of an email) that supports the technique.<br>
<br>
See "Help/Info/Docs -&gt; Data Format and Notes" for a full explanation of the format of the Family Data.<br>
<br>
Clickable areas include ID numbers and names (e.g., the "Father" line and/or the "Mother" line underneath the Head of Family line at the
beginning of a Family Group will be clickable; clicking here will jump to the Family Group of the father or mother). Any child who has his
or her own Family Group (indicated by the presence of an ID number) is clickable; clicking here will jump to that child's Family Group.
Citation references (enclosed within []) are clickable and clicking here will jump to the Citation being referenced. Any text containing a
pointer (-&gt;) is clickable and clicking here will bring up whatever is being pointed to in a new tab in the browser. Email addresses are
clickable which will enable an email to be sent to the address which was clicked. Web site addresses are clickable.<br>
<br>
Note - Email addresses and Web site addresses must be enclosed within &lt;&gt; in the Plain Text version of the Family DataBase in order for
Email addresses and Web site addresses to be clickable in the HTML version of the Family DataBase.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item4.3">"Plain Text Family Data"</a> -<br>
Display the plain text version of the currently active Family DataBase. If no Family DataBase is active this button will be disabled.<br>
<br>
Clicking this button will bring up a list of plain text files available for the active Family DataBase. Any of the entries in the list may
be clicked to display that particular data. Use the browser back button, if needed, to go back to the list of plain text files.<br>
<br>
Use the browser Print facility to print a portion of the family data to hard copy or to a file. Also, the "Cut &amp; Paste" interprocess
communication technique may be available for sharing smaller batches of information. Copy text by highlighting it with the mouse pointer,
and then paste it into another program (e.g., a text editor or the body of an email) that supports the technique.<br>
<br>
All MELGenKey Family DataBases will have a plain text version of the family data. All functions in MELGenKey that process family data
will use the plain text version as the basis for the processing (except "Display Family Data -&gt; HTML Family Data"). The format of
the Family Data is fully explained in "Help/Info/Docs -&gt; Data Format and Notes".<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
<a id="item5.1">"Edit Family Data"</a> -<br>
Use this menu item to edit the data in the currently active Family DataBase. If no Family DataBase is active this button will be disabled.
Re-verification of the DataBase will be done automatically upon completion of the changes. If a HTML version of the
Family DataBase exists, the HTML version will need to be re-created after any changes are made to the Family DataBase. Do not make changes
directly by hand to the HTML version of the Family DataBase. The HTML version should always be auto-created from the plain text
version using "Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase -&gt; Create HTML Version of Family DataBase".<br>
<br>
Note - This function is not yet available.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
<a id="item6.1">"Reports"</a> -<br>
Various reports can be produced.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width:50%">
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item6.2">"Produce Timeline"</a> -<br>
Note - If no Family DataBase is active then no family events can be included in the report.<br>
<br>
When choosing this menu item a form will display. At the top of the form a Start Date and an End Date must both be specified in full.
All other selections on the form are optional. Pertinent events from the active Family DataBase may be included for an individual by
entering his or her ID number, or for a child of an individual by entering the individual's ID number and his or her child's Roman Numeral
number from the Children Section of a Family Group. Also, an entire Family's pertinent events may be included in the Timeline Report by
entering the ID number on the Head of Family line.<br>
<br>
Certain types of Family events may be omitted from the report by clicking the appropriate box(es).<br>
<br>
Certian types of non-Family events may be included in the report by clicking the appropriate box(es).<br>
<br>
The date portion of an event may be hidden when it is identical to the previous event on a report.<br>
<br>
After completing the form, click the "Create Timeline" button to produce the report.<br>
<br>
The Timeline report may be printed either by using the browser built-in print function or by clicking the Print button at the bottom
of the report. In the latter case, a maximum line character length may be specified. In the former case any lines longer than the width of
the printer carriage will auto-wrap and appear as "run on" lines. In the latter case lines will not be output longer than the specified maximum
and continuation lines will be indented appropriately which may make the report appear more presentable.<br>
<br>
Note - The Timeline report may also be saved to a PDF file using the browser built-in print function.<br>

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item6.6">"On This Day"</a> -<br>
Note - If no Family DataBase is active then no family events can be included in the report.<br>
<br>
When choosing this menu item a form will display. At the top of the form, if not creating a Recurring On This Day Report (see below), a Month
and a Day must both be specified. All other selections on the form are optional. Pertinent events from the active Family DataBase may be
included by clicking the Family DataBase box.<br>
<br>
Certain types of Family events may be omitted from the report by clicking the appropriate box(es).<br>
<br>
Certian types of non-Family events may be included in the report by clicking the appropriate box(es).<br>
<br>
The date portion of an event that is displayed may be limited to the year only. Also, the date portion of an event may be hidden when it is
identical to the previous event on a report.<br>
<br>
After completing the form, click the "Create On This Day Report" button to produce the report immediately or click
"Establish Recurring Daily Report" to have a report emailed on a daily basis.<br>
<br>
If creating an immediate report, the resulting On This Day report may be printed either by using the browser built-in print function or by
clicking the Print button at the bottom of the report. In the latter case, a maximum line character length may be specified. In the former
case any lines longer than the width of the printer carriage will auto-wrap and appear as "run on" lines. In the latter case lines will not
be output longer than the specified maximum and continuation lines will be indented appropriately which may make the report appear more
presentable.<br>
<br>
Note - The On This Day report may also be saved to a PDF file using the browser built-in print function.<br>
<br>
If creating a recurring report, additional information will need to be input. After entering all information click
"Continue Establishing Recurring Daily Report" to complete the process. Multiple Recurring On This Day Reports, all containing different
information, may be created. To edit, delete, deactivate any recurring report, see "Miscellaneous Functions -> Manage Recurring Reports".<br>
<br>
Notes pertaining to the recurring report - The "From:" line in emails is overwritten by some relays (gmail for one). The server/node needs
to be running at the time the message is to be sent. If the Active Family DataBase is included, the info will reflect whatever Family DataBase
is active at the time the Recurring On This Day Report is created rather than whatever Family DataBase is active at the time the report is
emailed. If all info is entered and there are no other errors, the settings will be verified to ensure email can be sent. If the Relay Host,
Login or Password are incorrect an error message will display quickly. But, if Port is incorrect it may take several minutes to receive an
error message.<br>
<br>
If you are having trouble with the settings, a list of common SMTP settings: if using gmail (google) to relay outgoing emails, use
smtp.gmail.com for Relay and 587 or 465 for Port; if using Outlook/Office 365, smtp.office365.com and 587; if using Yahoo Mail,
smtp.mail.yahoo.com and 587 or 465; if using AOL, smtp.aol.com and 587; if using iCloud Mail, smtp.mail.me.com and 587. General recommendations:
Port 587 is the recommended port; Port 2525 is available by some providers; Port 25 is the original outgoing email port, it's often blocked
by ISPs to prevent spam and is generally not recommended.<br>

If no Family DataBase is active this button will be disabled.<br>
<br>
Use this function to display a step-by-step relationship line between two people who are directly related.<br>
<br>
Oftentimes a person likes to know how another person relates to a third person (usually an ancestor). This function will show that relationship.
The results of this function can be cut-n-pasted into the body of an email, or the results can be output to hard copy or to a PDF file.<br>
<br>
In the form, enter the IDs of the two people whom you wish to show the relationship. Then check the data you wish to be included. The checked
data will be included in all steps of the report. You may choose to abbreviate township, county, and the state (or Canadian province). Then
choose the number of dots to indent each step of the report (default is two dots). Then choose the order in which the ancestral steps should
show. When satisfied, click the "Create Point to Point Report" button to create the report.<br>
<br>
The Point to Point Ancestral Line report may be printed either by using the browser built-in print function or by clicking the Print button at
the bottom of the report. In the latter case, a maximum line character length may be specified. In the former case any lines longer than the

For the rest of the form, fill in as much information as desired (at least part of the name for the person being searched is required).
The more information that is filled in, the more specific the search results will be.<br>
<br>
After completing the form, click the "Search" button at the bottom.<br>
<br>
The results for each selection (the Active Family DataBase, the Web, each individual Web site) will be output to separate browser tabs.<br>
<br>
The Search report for a Family DataBase may be printed either by using the browser built-in print function or by clicking the Print button at
the bottom of the report. In the latter case, a maximum line character length may be specified. In the former case any lines longer than the
width of the printer carriage will auto-wrap and appear as "run on" lines. In the latter case lines will not be output longer than the
specified maximum and continuation lines will be indented appropriately which may make the report appear more presentable.<br>
<br>
The Search report for a Web site may only be printed by using the browser built-in print function.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item8.7">"Copy Active DataBase"</a> -<br>
If no Family DataBase is active this button will be disabled.<br>
<br>
Use this function to copy either an entire Family DataBase, or a Family Group while optionally including citation material and/or images
of people. The Family Data will be copied to a directory/folder. If wanting to copy just a portion of a Family Group, use the "Cut & Paste"
interprocess communication technique. To do this, while displaying either the Plain Text or HTML version of a Family DataBase, copy text
by highlighting it with the mouse pointer, and then paste it into another program (e.g., a text editor or the body of an email) that
supports the technique.<br>
<br>
Note that when only a Family Group is copied (as opposed to an entire Family DataBase), the PlainText version of the data is copied and NOT
the HTML version of the data.<br>
<br>
On the form select either the entire Family DataBase or a Family Group. If selecting a Family Group, that Family Group needs to be
identified. Enter either the ID of the Family Group or the full name of the person who is the head of the Family Group.<br>
<br>
Whether copying an entire Family DataBase or a Family Group, the referenced citation material may or may not be included by selecting or not
selecting the appropriate checkbox. Also, photos/images of people may or may not be included by selecting or not selecting the appropriate
checkbox.<br>
<br>
Finally, enter a relative path or a full path to the directory/folder where the data will be copied. Or, if a name is entered without any
path criteria then the location will be assumed to be within the user's home directory. The path must be the location of the directory/folder
(which will contain all the files after the copy is completed). If the directory/folder does not exist it will be created.<br>
<br>
If the path is relative, it should be relative to the location of MELGenKey. The location of MELGenKey can be noted via
"Miscellaneous Functions -> Display Info for MELGenKey".<br>
<br>
Once everything on the form is set, click on the "Proceed" button to continue. There will be a notification of any fatal errors stopping
the copying from taking place. If there are no fatal errors, there will be informational messages which should be read over before
continuing. The copying may also be canceled at this point.<br>

<br>
The Family DataBase must be successfully verified before an index can be created. To verify a Family DataBase click "Verify Family Data"
from the main menu.<br>
<br>
On the form, check the boxes of the associated areas in the Family Groups to be indexed. When satisfied, click the Continue button.<br>
<br>
The index will be sorted before it is saved. If an index already exists, it will be backed up before the new index is created and saved. If
an HTML version of the active Family DataBase exists, it will be removed and will need to be re-created.<br>
<br>
Notes - The indexing does not distinguish between separate individuals with the same name. All individuals with identical names will occupy one
index entry consisting of all references for all the individuals. The indexing relies, in part, upon capitalization. It's possible that names will
be missed, or false names will be added to the index (especially if indexing Questions, Extras, Explanations or Citations which all have a more
unstructured content). Proper names without a surname will not be indexed. Certain words appearing before the last name (towit: von, la, le,
de, van der, van de, van den - all case insensitive) will be assumed to be part of the surname.<br>

and an age will calculate the death date. Entering a death date and an age will calculate the birth date.<br>
<br>
The calculation takes into account leap years and the precise number of days in each month. CE/AD and BCE/BC dates are supported by
clicking the appropriate button to the right of each date that is entered. If both dates are entered, the death date will need to be
equal to, or later than, the birth date. Clicking the button near the middle of the page will force the calculation to take into

the Julian calendar and the Gregorian calendar. The change in calendar from Julian to Gregorian occurred at different times in different
parts of the world. This calculation will use the time it was changed in Great Britain and it's colonies (which includes America). The
last day of the Julian calendar was 2 Sep 1752 which was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, 14 Sep 1752. Selecting a date
between 3 Sep 1752 and 13 Sep 1752 inclusive will result in an invalid date.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="item8.32">"Map Deed Boundaries"</a> -<br>
Use this function to map the boundaries of a metes & bounds deed. Metes & Bounds deeds measure distance in feet, rods, poles, chains, etc. and
changes in direction are measured in degrees, minutes and seconds denoted by Cardinal directions.<br>
<br>
Select the number of screen pixels that should be equivalent to 1 measure (link, rod/perch/pole or chain). The other two measures will be
calculated based upon the selection. Then select the starting point for the boundary map (vertical pixel and horizontal pixel). A vertical pixel
of 0 and a horizontal pixel of 0 will be the upper left-hand corner of the "canvas" where the first boundary line will begin. The starting point
might want to be based upon the predominate directions that the deed takes. For example, if the predominant boundary line directions are north
and east, make the starting point in the lower left (the pixel point at the lower left will depend upon the size of your screen display). Next
select the direction and number of measure units for chains, rods/perches/poles and links for the first boundary line. If there is an angle
associated with the first boundary line (i.e., the line is not due north, due east, due south or due west) then select the degrees, minutes,
and/or seconds and the angle direction for the first boundary line. Now, click "Add Boundary Line". Repeat for the second boundary line, then
the third, etc until completed. Each boundary line that is added will start from the end of the previous boundary line. If all the boundary
distances and directions are entered correctly, the last boundary line should end where the very first boundary line started.<br>
<br>
At any time you may click "Undo Last Boundary Line" in order to do the line over again. Or click "Reset/Restart" to start over again from the
beginning.<br>
<br>
Text may also be added to the boundary map. At any time select "Text to add", and the vertical and horizontal screen pixel placement for the
text. Then click "Add Text". The last text that was added may be undone by clicking "Undo Last Text".<br>
<br>
After the boundary map is completed it may be printed or saved to a PDF file by using the browser's Print facility.<br>

add a new Web Address or select a Web Address in order to edit its parameters.<br>
<br>
If adding a Web Address, on the ensuing form, enter a Web Page/Address to monitor. A full Web Address must be entered including the
protocol (http or https). Examples of valid Web Addresses are "https://google.com" and "https://mlake.net/Lake/HTML/tableofcontents.html"
(without the quotes). "google.com" (without the quotes) is not a fully valid Web Address in this case. Also, using http for a https
Web Site may fail depending upon how the Web site is configured. Set the desired Check Interval (the check will occur at 1400 hours (2 PM),
every day if daily, Sunday if weekly, or the first day of the month if monthly). Set the preferred Active setting. When satisfied with all
the settings, click the button labeled "Click to Complete the Add/Edit". If the settings are valid, the current contents of the Web Address
will be recorded and this entry will be added to the list of Web Pages/Addresses being Monitored. If the contents of a specified Web Address
changes, a notification in the form of an alert will be issued to MELGenKey. Currently, if a MELGenKey client is not running at the time the
notification is sent then the notification will be lost. (This behavior will change in a future release of MELGenKey.) However, a pertinent
message will always be recorded by node/server logging mechanism. These log messages can be seen via
"Miscellaneous Functions -> MELGenKey Log Messages".<br>
<br>
If editing an already existing Web Address entry, any changes may be made. When satisfied with the changes click the button labeled
"Click to Complete the Add/Edit" to complete the edit process. Additionally, when editing an already existing Web Address entry, there is
an opportunity to delete the entry by clicking the "Delete Entry" button.<br>
<br>
Note - After making all the desired additions and/or edits, the "Save" button must be clicked. If the additions/edits are not saved, they
will be lost when leaving this page. The interval checking process for any added or edited Web Address entries will begin after being saved.<br>
<br>
Note - This check does not traverse through pages/files/links which might be called by the page/file to which the address points. If it
is desired to, for example, monitor multiple files or pages on the same Web site then add multiple Web Addresses, each one pointing to a
different file or page to monitor for content changes.<br>
<br>
Note - The server/node needs to be running at the time any of the Web pages are to be checked for content changes. If the server/node is
not running, then any checks that were scheduled to be made will be missed/skipped.<br>
