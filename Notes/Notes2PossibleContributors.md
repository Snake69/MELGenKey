MELGenKey - Notes to Possible Contributors {#header}
==========================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\


    I welcome any and all help or contributions to this project (MELGenKey).
    The project is too large for me alone.

    Anyone considering contributing to this project should read these notes first.

    My programming background is mostly various assembler languages and some C.
    I've dabbled in several other languages.

    MELGenKey is a genealogy assistant program, and will run as-is on Linux,
    Apple or Microsoft Windows.

    MELGenKey is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  This is my first attempt
    at anything in JavaScript.  Additionally, I'm learning JavaScript as I go.
    I did not learn it before starting this project.  To be sure, there is a
    lot of code that can be [much] improved.  I have not used any frameworks
    in the project, and I have tried to use external libraries only when I feel
    I have to or am better off if I do.  The code is not well commented ... yet.

    MELGenKey is a "Full Stack" application.  Both the client-side and the
    server-side (nodejs) is envisioned to reside on the same computer.
    Eventually, I foresee one computer running MELGenKey being able to
    communicate with another computer running MELGenKey.  Also, eventually,
    I hope that MELGenKey will be able to systemically update data on various
    sites (WikiTree, Ancestry, FamilySearch, etc) and vice-versa.

    MELGenKey is being developed in a modular fashion so that each module/function
    is standalone and not dependent upon any other module (as much as possible).

    Several modules/functions are runnable, most all of which need some sort of
    improvement(s) or additional code.  A few of the running modules/functions
    need quite a bit of additional code (importing a database from a Gedcom
    comes to mind).  And several modules/functions have yet to be started.
    Perusing the documentation in the Docs directory will help you see which
    modules are currently runable.  See the file (from the MELGenKey root
    directory)  Notes/ToDo.txt  for an idea of things that need to be done.
    (The contents of the file are likely incomplete.)

    Also, I have no experience dealing with projects on Github with multiple
    developers and don't know what I'm doing.
