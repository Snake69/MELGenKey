Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase -> Import a Family DataBase from a GEDCOM
  if the Gedcom file is a zip file, unzip it before importing
  function incomplete; add all possible items
  need to be able to handle importing Gedcom files larger than 200MB
  allow for a "Combo Import" so that a GEDCOM is imported along with files that belong in the Other directory, index, etc
  allow data to be created and not imported
  (see Notes.txt for GEDCOM specs)
  option to start and stop at certain points
  for starting point give user option to:
    enter name - use exact match (verify first), if multiple exact matches send user list to choose from, if no exact matches send user
      list of near matches, if no near matches send user list of all individuals
    start with first individual in GEDCOM
  as part of final result, produce a report
    list all records/lines/tags which were disregarded/ignored
  allow for a DATE of (upper or lower case) "FROM 1920 TO 1923" or "1920 TO 1923" or "1920 - 1923" or "1920-1923"
  certain tags should still show something in family group even if there are no sub-level tags (e.g., if "1 ADOP" is present for an INDI but
    there are no associated "2 blah" records, then there should be a note saying individual was adopted)
  EMAIL tag may contain 1 @ or 2 consecutive @'s; if 2, make 1 
  "Check Here to Choose from a List of Individuals" should auto-uncheck if text is entered in box by user & if
    "Check Here to Choose from a List of Individuals" is checked by user then text in box should auto-erase
  handle 0 @.....@ OBJE records; if 1 FILE link-to-file record present, download file
  remove multiple identical Citation references on same Note line
  items/events NOT added to the MELGenKey Family DataBase because there was no associated source
    list items not added in log

Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase -> Import a Family DataBase from User Created Files
  if a zip file, unzip it before importing

Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase -> Create HTML Version of Family DataBase
  increase size of font used for Section Headings
  the links to indexes should all be upper case (e.g., indexA.html rather than indexa.html) even if first letter of surname is lower case
  link IDs in DevHistory.txt to Family Groups
  make index a button in tableofcontents and make it stand out at top of page
  tie not being able to wrap certain IDs with "disable" check in Verify
    currently Verify is not verifying IDs below the generation specified in the "disable" check; Create HTML is flagging these IDs with
      informational messages in the Log file - stop putting out info msgs for disabled IDs
  rewrite comparison code when looking for proper file to point to (3 or 4 places in CreateHTML.js)
  change filenames created in HTML directory so that they display in a more user-friendly sort order (body1.html, body2.html, etc)
  file size should be an option; (two options) file size around ----; file size not to exceed ----
  each "slot" in mapfiles[] must provide for at least 1 Family Group

  improve HTML
    link locations to maps (states to dirs, specific locations to specific maps if they exist)
      result should be in layers (e.g., a link to a city maps to the city itself, the user can back out to the township, the county,
        the state, the country, the world); see more notes elsewhere here
      if there is an associated date or time frame then the map MUST be pertinent to that time (Newberry maps)

    hovering over a source reference shows source name (from Citation Section) in a pop-up
    clicking on a location should bring up appropriate map for the appropriate time period in a new tab (see elsewhere here for more notes)
  emplement a simple recursive search of the UnsureIfRelated directory
    do multiple recoll indexes:  LAKE Unsure area (already done), KILLE Unsure area

    https://www.recoll.org/usermanual/webhelp/docs/RCL.PROGRAM.PYTHONAPI.INTRO.html
  make the index selections more prominent
    perhaps add a button to table of contents page for index rather than listing the various indexes at bottom of table of contents page

Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase -> Deport a Family DataBase
  back up data
  do anything if it's the active DB ?
  add indicator to backed-up directory name so it is known it was deported

Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase -> Re-Import a Deported Family DataBase

Verify Family Data
  may need to change Docs, Docs/VerificationChecks.html and/or Include/ExampleOfUserCreatedFiles
  ran into 1 strange issue where the end of the Family Group was EOL, X, EOL, EOL
    the X was an undisplayable character (vi didn't even acknowledge the character was there)
    HOW TO HANDLE THIS ?
  check for correctness of locale names (different names at different times, area creation times, etc)
  https://geographic.org/geographic_names/index.html

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_U.S._counties
  the names of people at the head of family groups with no parents need to be cited
  check that all children and HOF Line when not a child in another Family Group have gender indicator
  like:
    199.0  Herbert Ryder (M) [1]

    Children:

    i.    Fred. (M) [3]
    ii.   Elizabeth. (F) [3]
    iii.  name unknown. (U) [3]

  bug
    "Notes -" header missing, Verify did not catch it
      how to catch this?
      what if multiple or all headers are missing?
      if columns 1-11 of a line contains a date, then we know there must be a Timeline header

  add option on command line to auto-fix problems which can be fixed
    ask user before fixing
    do not fix anything
    accept corrected data from user
  add check for multiple periods in ID
  when verifying the index, 2 spaces not being after name can be easily auto-fixed
  add line number (or exact text in error) to errors
  check for non-ASCII characters
  when checking Children Section for match on name in index & first name is "------", look for "name unknown"
  speed up sorting references in each line of index
  speed up sorting index - try quicksort algorithm
    see links in "Other Bookmarks" section in Firefox
    time Verifying SOT2-LAKE using current sorting technique - 2 hours, 29 minutes

    https://www.zerobounce.net/email-guides/email-validation-javascript/
    https://www.usebouncer.com/email-validation-javascript/
    perhaps use this to verify email address (on the server side):
      https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-existence
      This will ping the email address; if no response it will return false or else true.

      function doesEmailExist(email) {
          var emailExistence = require('email-existence');
          return emailExistence.check(email,function (err,status) {
              if (status)

              else
                  throw new Error('Email does not exist');
          })
      }
  any header can appear only once per Family Group
  look for semi-colons separating facts in Notes section (look for semi-colons by keying off on reserved words)
  when user verifies a DB with HTML version present, the status flag in MELGenKey.txt should be set to unverified & saved at the same time
    the HTML version is deleted
  ensure each event has a citation reference (except where there is only 1 citation)
  enclose Web addresses within <> (so that they will wrap in CreateHTML)
    go through DB looking for any string (ending in comma, rt paren, space or \n), starting in http:// or https://,
      first character cannot be <, last character cannot be >, string must contain at least 1 period, string cannot
        contain ->,@
      precede string with http:// if necessary, enclose within <>, then create anchor (<a>)
    look for code examples for determining a Web link
    give user option to auto-correct or manual correct
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/linkifyjs
  alert displays because HTML version exists & will need to be re-created; click OK; the Continue button does not disable
  need to check for which button is clicked in alert with addEventListener (see CreateHTML.html)
  look for filename references in Citations section (or anywhere else in Family Group) which are not formatted properly (no ->)
  validate FullName - only characters allowed are letters, - and '; no prefixes/titles (Dr, Sir, Pvt, Sgt, Col, etc);
                      no suffixes (Jr, Sr, roman numerals, PhD, MD)
  check for duplicate citation lines in same Family Group
  ensure each citation line is referenced at least once in Family Group
  if "Children by FullName and FullName:" then there must be multiple marriages in Family Group
  if "Children:" then there must NOT be multiple marriages in Family Group
  ensure "child #X, name" and "Child #X, name" in Family Group matches name and Roman Numeral number in Children Section
  ensure roman numerals are in sequence with no skips
  index
    see ~mlake/Dev/CheckIndex
    ensure first letter of [most] names and initials are upper case
  General options for Verify
  allow option to do a full check (format like what I devised) or skeletel check (check basic format, see docs)
    a basic check allows user to format family info any way he/she wants
    things which are checked are headings, family ID line, Father line, Mother line, ensure sourcecitation references, timeline dates
    content can be formatted as the user wishes but some things which must be a certain way:
      when a timeline event is continued the date field must be blank and the content must be indented 2 positions on the following lines
    display a dialog where user can checkmark each individual validity check he/she wants to perform
    each individual check should be able to be allowed or not by the user
      or the user can select DON'T ASK AGAIN
    allow for auto-correction where possible
    incorporate spellchecker into validity-check code
  output errors
  output changes made
  output comments (e.g., when an ID is skipped sequentially ... note it to user
  "Timeline -"
    should contain word "living", not "lived"
    should contain word "working", not "worked"
    should contain word "sells", not "sold"
    should contain word "purchases", not "purchased"
    should contain word "moves", not "moved"
    should contain "[name] and [name] married", not "[name] married [name]"
      the second [name] cannot be the same name as the head of the family
    certain events should be in a certain format (e.g., "born" should always be followed by "in" or a CR)
    check for more than 1 consecutive blank after the date (starting in column 12) (take into account continuation lines)
    ensure birthdate for a head-of-family is also in parents' Timeline
    ensure birthdates & info for children match that in childrens' own family group
    check for two consecutive dates in Timeline which are exactly the same
    check for duplicate entries except for date (e.g., "Margaret Good born" appearing more than once - could be in Timeline and/or Notes sections)
  "Notes -"
    "known as" - name should be enclosed within quotes
    should contain word "lived", not "living"
    should contain word "worked", not "working"
    should contain "[name] married [name]", not "[name] and [name] married"
      the second [name] cannot be the same name as the head of the family
    each line must start in column 1
    must be blank line between notes
    check for duplicate notes
    check for more than 1 consecutive blank
    source/citation reference must exist if there is more than one Source/Citation
    source/citation reference must NOT exist if there is only one Source/Citation
    if multiple source/citation references for a note then they must be sequential
  "Observations -"
    each line must start in column 1
    source/citation reference must exist if there is more than one Source/Citation
    source/citation reference must NOT exist if there is only one Source/Citation
  "Extras -"
    if any of these lines appear they must be preceded by 1 blank line
      must be followed by a non-blank line
    if multiple source/citation references for an item then they must be sequential
  "Further Research -"
  "Biography -"
  Other checks:
    alert (and allow changes) when locations are incorrect based upon available maps
    spell check
    double dates out of range (1 Jan - 25 Mar, after 1752)
    check for possibly-still-living people - point out to user; optionally remove
    ensure twins, triplets, etc are noted as such
    ensure double dates/dual dates are in their proper sequence
    look for dates which should have a 'd' in column 7 of Timeline
    ensure the only entry in a family group for a child who has his/her own family group is for birth
    specify right margin (in Notes use semi-colon for breaking lines, what about other sections?)
    look for unnecessary Timeline entries for children (when a child has its own entry then the only entry in the parents' entry
      should be birthdate)
    each event should contain at least one key word (allow user to add to list of key words)
    try to put certain Notes in a certain sequence; e.g., "born" should be first, "buried" should be last,
      "died" should be next to last (if "buried" present, last if not)
    check for correct spelling of all reserved words (married, died, born, etc, states, counties, what else?)
    check if image reference missing in Source/Citation line
    ensure each Source/Citation item is spelled exactly the same everywhere in the book that it is used
    ensure all "links" (->) work
    ensure a numeric actually is a numeric
    ensure every name in body of book is in index (missing are some Sources/Citations (e.g., Marshall Edward Lake (1.)) and
      non-transcribed articles)
    check for word "married" in each family entry
    check for missing "living in ..." events (e.g., when parents are shown as "living in ..." during a year after child is born)
    ensure email addresses are enclosed within <>
      validate email address - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-can-i-validate-an-email-address-in-javascript
    ensure Web addresses are enclosed within <> and start with http:// or https://
    check Web addresses to make sure page still exists
    remove extra spaces used for alignment (i.e., ALWAYS have 2 spaces after IDs & wherever else EXCEPT WITH CHILDREN)
    change 1st to first, 2nd to second, etc
    use geographical timeline as input to do checks and completions (add correct county name for the time, add correct township name
      for the time, ensure correct placename (e.g., certain areas would be territories before a certain time, or colonies before a certain
      time), etc) also, see http://www.geonames.org/
    compare the current index with the body and point out errors/inconsistencies
      some indexing errors may be able to be handled programmically
        names associated with family ID numbers (beginning of family entries, where else?) can be auto-indexed programmically
        for names as the head of family entries add an asterisk to that index entry ?
        check referenced files (plain text or graphical images) for further indexing
    body - 2 spaces after number & before name
    compare info in new files to old files (dates, what else?)
    ensure when dashes occur (for a missing name) it's always 6 dashes
    ensure "transcribed" in files in the Reference directory is noted where appropriate
  when Auto-Delete Failed References in Index checked, remove any references to files in PlainText files which are removed based upon value of
    "Disable checks below generation:"
  save an indication that DB is verified while disabling checks below a particular generation so this can be made use of in other functions
    such as "Create HTML" where certain IDs are not able to be wrapped because they do not exist & an error msg is generated in log
  add count of various types of messages (errors, warnings, info) to report
  when encountering [] which does not contain all numerics, note it with an info message rather than error it
  add option to auto-remove files in Reference directory which are not used in Family DataBase
  sometimes in Citations a directory is referenced; in this case no file within the directory should be flagged as non-referenced
  add option to auto-delete any references in index where the associated individual does not appear in the referenced Family Group
    this may mean just the reference gets deleted or the entire entry gets deleted
    for individuals where the reference check is disabled will NOT be auto-deleted if the disabled option is indicated
  check that last character in each entry in Account Section and Childrens Section is ] (it may not be if Family Group has only 1 Citation)
  option to check for inactive Web links (Web links must be enclosed within <> ?)
  option to check for inactive email addresses (email addresses must be enclosed within <> ?)
  allow for other files (any imported DB, a DB not yet imported) besides the active DB to be verified
  add form for options
    fix certain simple things - spelling of reserved words, placement of reserved words
      auto-fix or ask before fixing
      include informational output as well as errors in report
    allow only ":" for Section Headers as in "Children:" 
    allow only " - for Section Headers as in "Children -"
    allow either ":" or " -"
    (allowing these options will need to be handled in other functions as well, e.g. searching for "Children:" or "Children -")
  at times there are encounters which *could* be an error
    on Timeline Report - Possible error. Is such-and-such correct?
  there needs to be additional checks in Childrens Section
    birthdate sequence
    Roman Numeral sequence
  check for the same reference (->) being found or not found just once per Family Group
  Timeline event should contain "[name] and [name] married", not "[name] married [name]"
    the second [name] cannot be the same name as the head of the family; HOF name must be first name
  certain Timeline events should be in a certain format (e.g., "born" should always be followed by "in" or a CR)
  Timeline events: check for more than 1 consecutive blank after the date (starting in column 12) (take into account continuation lines)
  see DataFormat.html
  verifying index:
    see ~mlake/Dev/CheckIndex
    allow user to select which checks to perform
    allow user to set certain formatting checks (e.g., 1 or 2 spaces after name)
    somehow mark the particular reference for a person which points to the main family group for that person (perhaps surround the reference
      with [] or (), or follow the reference with *, or some other way)
      NOTE - ONE OF THE VALIDITY CHECKS MAY BE FOR THE INDEX TO CONTAIN NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS 
    verify sort order (str.split(",").sort().join(","))

Family DataBase Activation
  rewrite function to use Select/Option
  when "MELGenKey DataBase Activation" is clicked provide the user with a list of DBs to choose from
  allow DB to be deactivated (? - isn't this already being done by clearing the checkbox and saving)
  NOTE - user can have up to 20 imported DBs at any one time
  possibly remove MELGenKey DataBase Activation functionality and instead add a DB selection box/area in each function where active DB is used?
    or perhaps make it a Preference that the user can set
    or both

Display Family Data -> HTML Family Data
Display Family Data -> Plain Text Family Data

Edit Family Data
  some of these may also apply to Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase -> Import a Family DataBase from User Created Files
  offer various ways for user to edit DB
    allow user to use their favorite system editor (vi, notepad, TextEdit (Mac), etc)
    provide a textarea via HTML (ala NotesActDB.html or GenNotes.html) 
      see https://github.com/Benarjishyam/collabarative-text-editor
    provide a form which can be filled in to update/create a Family Group
      if updating an already existing Family Group, the form will be filled in with data already there; user will then edit
    user can input a specially formatted file which will auto-update a DB
  allow for notification to be sent to data creator and to anyone user has shared data with when DataBase is updated
  any change by user should ripple through database (e.g., ID references), also update index if needed
  when changes are made to a DB, also alert user to other changes which MELGenKey cannot make (e.g., names or id refs in photos); verification
    should optionally happen; backup (?) and delete HTML version (if it exists) and alert user it needs to be re-created

Reports -> Produce Timeline
  take into account a 5-position year in Timeline files (digit in column 12)
    (the following events were removed from Include/Timelines/GeneralTimeline.txt)
        -30000 Cro-Magnon man is flourishing, moving from the Near East into
                 Europe, lives by hunting and gathering. Cro-Magnons painted
                 caves with drawings of the animals they killed. [7]
        -25000 Bering Strait is crossed by humans, connecting Asia to the
                 Americas. [7]
        -18000 Clay pottery ware is created; humans begin to use raw metals. [7]
        -10000 Humans make it to the southern most point of South America. [7]

    for auto-completion, don't just start at beginning of name but start anywhere in name
  allow user to pick a state (or states) in USA, a county (or counties) in USA, and country (or countries) in world to include
  allow for multiple IndIDs and/or multiple children and/or multiple FamIDs by separating IDs with some character (whitespace, ;) in text boxes
  allow for entire active Family DB
  add option to not include circa-dated events
  add option to include age for people (in the Family DB) appearing in a Timeline Report event when known
  allow decimal number on form for ChildID
  change check for ChildID from valid Roman Numerals to a valid Roman Numeral number (e.g., iiiii would be invalid)
  allow user to specify a child with it's own ID; in this case go to where the child is specified as being the Head of Family 
  include USA directory in Timeline Report when appropriate
  option to include Citations/Sources
  option to shift non-family events to the right an optionally selected number of columns (so that they can be more easily identified

    (e.g., after event and Citation Reference, add (Gen) for General Timeline, (Fam) for Family DataBase, (WWI) for World War I, etc)
    add a legend after the end of the report and after Citations which will describe abbreviations
    (e.g., Gen = General Timeline, Fam = Family DataBase, etc)
  possibly change form/logic to include individual _OR_ family ??
    if not, need to add name to unnamed events (living, lives, moves, moved, etc)
  if doing a report for a child, add child's name into header (same line as where HOF name appears)
  in form, for start & end dates, allow just year or month & year to be entered
  add option to include USA state, territory, DC
  give user option of setting the NEW LINE (continuation line?) column
  like in OnThisDay Report:
    allow month & day to be omitted from report (this may be useful if the user is getting a Timeline report for only Births, Deaths, etc)
  form - add beginning and ending year to selections where appropriate

Reports -> Determine Relationship
  most recent common ancestor between two people

  recurring message for On This Day
    allow for html email
    allow multiple entry fields for Family DB Name (also for non-recurring report, or perhaps force user to use Manage Recurring Reports?)
      and to whom email is being sent
  option to output events occurring only in locations where family(s) lived
  option to output events by location
  option to include Citation material
  add Number of Events to Report
  when a child from a Family DB appears in report there's not enough info; perhaps include surname or Family Group ID
  add validity checks (month must be 01 through 12, day must be 01 through 31)
  add check for day 31 (not valid for Sep, Apr, Jun & Nov; Feb, only through 28; allow for leap years)
  allow one-position entries
  when form appears the month and day should be today
  add option to include all Family DBs

Reports -> Produce Bio
  change system alert to dialog
  remove the refresh and figure out why the data is appended when doing multiple bios
  add a Print button to window in new tab
  fix bugs in some wording
    in the following lines, Daniel Pierson Case (9.200) is the subject of the bio and Minnie Sturm is the spouse
      "On 20 Dec 1854, Daniel Pierson Case born in " should be "On 20 Dec 1854, Daniel Pierson Case was born in "
      "On 19 Jan 1855, Daniel Pierson Case Minnie Sturm born." should be "On 19 Jan 1855, Minnie Sturm was born."
      "In 1879, Daniel Pierson Case Minnie Sturm living in " should be "In 1879, the family was living in "
        this is because Daniel Pierson Case is still alive in 1879; if he was deceased then line might be "In 1879, Minnie Sturm living in "
      "On 8 Jun 1977, Daniel Pierson Case child #3, Rectford David, died." should be "On 8 Jun 1977, the third child, Rectford David, died."
      there may be more wording bugs to fix; ask Gemini - upload pertinent code & family group 9.200, point out wording errors
  add some randomness to sentence structure
  give user options to create bio using AI (user may have to have a login for AI)
    or to use a <textarea> to display the bio making it editable
    see Notes/UserUsingGemini.txt 
  option to abbreviate Township, County, state name (see AncestralLine.html)
  option to use full date or just year 
  option to show full date in different formats (dd mmm yyyy, dd fullmonthname yyyy, fullmonthname dd, yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy, etc)

Reports -> Design a Report
  allow user to create their own reports
    see algorithm in NSB where formulas can be created by user
    see algorithm in RP where poker games can be created by user
    select items by keying off on "reserved words" like twins, triplets, born, died, buried, married
    provide the capability for a user to create any type of report through some sort of control language
    for most reports allow user to specify number of generations forward and/or backward from a family or other point
    Timelines (& Notes? & Sources?) of multiple families to be combined and output
      Timelines can be by an individual, a family, relationship to a defined degree (e.g., siblings, first cousins, second cousins, etc),
        a surname, an ancestry, within a generation, a certain time period (1 day to a wide span of days, or a month, a year),
        anniversary (1 year ago from selected date, 2 years ago, 3 years ago, etc ... also can be 1 year ago, etc within a certain span of time)
      include world events, USA events, MLB events, family events (option to include source), state events
      also include things going on at the time ... like Rev War, WWI, WWII, etc
      user can select particular items from Timeline, e.g. all deed transactions, all entries having to do with wills, all births, etc
      if 1 day is requested then optionally output only the year with each event
      optionally output event on one line (remove CRs)
      optionally include in events relationship identification (e.g., wife of, sister of, mother of, etc)
    select people by category
      people who served in Armed Forces
      people who served during a war
    location plotter for entire DB
    "this day in our family" (ala http://www.mlake.net/history.html)

    capability to produce a location report of relatives living within a certain distance of a user-supplied location
    "this day" reports
      options to include world events, USA events, MLB events, family events (option to include source), state events
      option to show relationships
      option to show common ancestor
      allow a time span on either side of the inputted date to include events
      allow inputted date to be a month, a year, a decade, a century
      allow report to be emailed daily
    save report to file (plain text, PDF) or print
    a GEDCOM starting from a certain point
      include only direct ancestry
      include children
      include cousins (everyone)
      go forward from starting point, or backward, or both
    a storybook (bio) of a family or families

        Natural, Compromise
    direct line report (one person's direct line going back ... offer short & long versions)
  allow user to change design of already-available report as to where info goes and what info shows

Search/Inspect/Analyze Family Data -> Search
  include full text search at familysearch.org in Internet results
  when searching the Internet use several search engines - google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, CC Search, Yahoo, Boardreader 
    see https://nodesource.com/blog/express-going-into-maintenance-mode
    the following will check if an URL is active:
      const urlExist = require("url-exist");
      (async () => {
          const exists = await urlExist("https://google.com");
          // Handle result
          console.log(exists)
      })();

        for the time being I could use (but apparently the "request" package is being removed eventually):
          see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60249127/should-i-use-the-request-module-for-a-new-project

      var http = require('http'),
          options = {method: 'HEAD', host: 'stackoverflow.com', port: 80, path: '/'},
          req = http.request(options, function(r) {
              console.log(JSON.stringify(r.headers));
          });
      req.end();

  add factors
  output hits in a sorted order based upon match score
  if search doesn't find a match, tell user where mismatch occurs; e.g., if searching for Marshall Lake whose father's name is Harold John Lake,
     results should say 0 matches because middle name of John doesn't match
  add STOP SEARCH button ... make visible & enable only after SEARCH button pressed; if STOP SEARCH pressed then display results up to that point
  Search is finding short names, e.g. entering 'Alex' for firstname and 'Kish' for lastname will match on Alexander Kishbaugh
    is that what we want?  perhaps mark it as a possible (to determine 'possible' will need to check for space after Alex in familydata)
    if we leave it like that, make sure to not that in docs (Alex will find Alex, Alexa, Alexander, etc; lex will find nothing)
  if user enters space after name, it won't find anything - use trim like in Timeline routine
    also use trim() when searching entire Web
  when matching on lastname for a child, add routine to look for a sibling who has it's own family
  always ignore case
  take into account double (or more) HOFs
  option to omit particular families (enter family IDs separated by commas or hyphens, use * to omit an entire generation - e.g. 1.*)
  rank results best to worst, put possibles at end
    in order to do this, will need to save all matches before outputting results
  allow for initials
  matching only on lastname is a special case; if lastname is found then each child in that family group needs to be checked
  how will I search images?

    https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-extract-text-from-an-image-using-javascript-8fe282fb0e71/
  what about doc files, rtf files, zip files, etc?
  when searching images search for the primary name(s) only
  search through Reference directory
  results should be clickable and will display the family if clicked, highlight match
  how to handle short names? (e.g., user enters Ed for firstname)
  how to handle abbreviated names? (e.g., user enters Wm for firstname)
  add checkboxes to each line in Search results:
    Previously Checked
    Contents Changed Since Last Checked
    Monitor Contents for Changes?
  currently, search matching on place names
    how to avoid matching on place names?
    https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/guides/authorities/place-authority
  currently, search results erroneous when initials are involved (e.g., if searching for first name of Thomas - "H. Thomas Lake" will match)
  need to add to report as each match is found
    # of matches should appear at top of results
    search should be able to find multiple different people in same family group, one example - if searching for first name of Johan and last
      name of Kille ... at times the Germans used different middle names with the same first name for different people
  allow user to use any of several search engines
    it seems that requesting a search at several individual sites doesn't work as expected (pages get a captcha); perhaps using a
      different search engine for each individual site will get around that
    search engines:
      Google
      Bing.com
      Perplexity.ai
      You.com
      SearchGPT
      Yep.com
      Openverse
      Yahoo.com
      Ecosia
      Aol
      DuckDuckGo
      Startpage
      Swisscows
      Gibiru
      Brave
      Wiki.com
      X (Formerly Twitter)
      SlideShare
      Wayback Machine
      WolframAlpha
      LinkedIn
      Baidu
      Yandex
      Sogou
      Naver
  allow user to add to list of Individual Sites to search - perhaps keep a private file of individual sites that the user can manage
  googling and searching a Family DB might be two different types of searches
    for a Family DB, user might want to search for a person whose parents were such and such, whose children were such and such, etc
  add more search fields
    add a third name? fourth?
    add a second year; if so, lessen yr+/- options
  add option to search all imported DataBases
  keep a search score (e.g., matching exactly on name might be worth 5 points; matching exactly on first and last name but not the
    middle name might be worth 4 points, etc) and output results based upon score
  use fuse
  for searching graphical files, see /var/www/html/WORK & recoll
    does google search graphical files?; if so, add graphical file search just for Family DataBases
  perhaps this is just for Inspect or Analyze?
    have different forms depending upon what user is looking for ...
    a SPOUSE (unknown name or only first name known)
      base search upon location, timing, names of children
      (child name could be same [first or maiden] name as unknown spouse, or parent of spouse, or possibly sibling of unknown spouse;
        ditto for middle name of child
      obvious - look for same name for known spouse with the same info (dates, kids, location)
      check the names of neighbors
    for entering children & siblings ... when one is entered, display another entry point (begin by showing just one child and sibling;
      there can be an unlimited number of children and siblings)
  in addition to family data, search Reference/*, PlainText/UnsureIfRelated/* and images
  when searching active DB, add checkbox to search UnsureIfRelated
    options to not search Unsure directories or to only search Unsure directories
  when searching active DB, take into account year in Timeline could be blank
  when searching active DB, allow for +/- year
  speed up search of active DB
  allow user to add, delete, edit list of sites to search
    will need to validate it
      using a form will make validating unecessary for:
        TAB character
      field 1 = address
      TAB character
      field 2 = description (will show in List Box)
      no null lines
  allow for automated searches
  allow words within x number of words from each other
  allow user to look for certain children with certain parents
    e.g., a user wants to look for a specific child name with specific parents, or one parent (with surname)
          a user wants to look for a specific parent name with a specific child
          a user wants to look for specific sibling names with a specific child
          a user wants to look for a specific name in a specific locale (county, state, etc)
          a user wants to look for a specific name in a specific time period
  search for digital images/collections
    by surname
    by place
  searching/matching points:
    father - born / died & places
    mother - born / died & places
    siblings = born / died & places
    spouse - born / died & places
    children - born / died & places, number of
    third/fourth in a line (e.g., if user wants to look for a "James III" the look for a James who had a James who had a James)
    where subject lived
      city          -| 
      township      -| 
      county         |- use these for all places
      state         -| 
      country       -|
    time subject lived
    type of work subject did
    served in Armed Forces?
    served in Armed Forces during a war?
    when & where baptized
    where buried
    when marriage
    NOTEs - for names & dates, allow exact, ? and *
            for dates allow +/-
  search Internet, Gedcoms, etc looking for possible matches (perhaps use fuse) which could tie into a Family Group in a MELGenKep DB
    use matching rules (rules would be different for different types of data (dates, names, places, etc)

Search/Inspect/Analyze Family Data -> Inspect
  add chronological checks to events for the same person (e.g., a person can't have been born after he/she died)
  include Notes Section in the check for multiple birth, death, baptismal or burial events
    e.g., in the Timeline Section there may be an event "23 Jan 2010 Joe Blow born in Binghamton, New York" and in the Notes Section there
      may be a note "Joe Blow born in Binghamton, New York."
  some of these checks should be optional and itemized on a select page which the user can checkmark for the check to be performed
  add link checker option (and/or in Verify)
  include WARNING or INFO for any item in report which is not an ERROR
  ensure birthdate, associated info and citation(s) for a head-of-family is also in parents' Timeline
  ensure children are listed in birth order
  ensure children numbers (roman numerals) are in sequence with no skips
  check for potential twins, triplets, etc
  siblings with same first name
  check death date for mother versus birth year of children
  check death date for father versus birth year of children
  check for person not of age concerning legal documents
  look for events for an individual after their death date (some are ok like buried, will proved, estate inventory made,
    court record concerning estate, newspaper article concerning person or estate, etc)
  checks which user can set:
    lifespan
    max age for male to be a father
    min age for male to be a father
    check birth year of mother versus birth year of all children
    max age for female to be a mother
    min age for female to be a mother
    max age difference between siblings
    min age difference between siblings
    max age difference between spouses
    max age when baptized
    max age when marrying
    min age when marrying
    max age when retiring
    min age when retiring
  check place names against geographical timelines
    see http://www.geonames.org/
        https://geonames.nga.mil/geonames/GNSHome/index.html
  allow user to create his own inspect criteria
  allow user to filter out particular inspection criteria
  check surname spelling is consistent
  check place names are consistent
  insure married name entered as a maiden name
  suspicious dates
    big gaps between children births
    big gap between marriage & firstborn child
    children born too close together
    children born when mother is older than 45 (allow user to specify age)
    children born when mother is too young
    children born when father is too young
    children born before marriage
  look for problems in a family:  questionable dates, questionable places, large time span between children,
    large time span between marriage and first child, etc
  check citations against data to ensure citation says what data shows
  list of other possible checks:
    Gender not defined
    Person beyond normal life span but not marked as deceased
    person too young for marriage
    woman too old to have a child
    Special characters or spacing in names
    siblings with same first name when both children are alive at same time
    Persons not connected to others in tree

Search/Inspect/Analyze Family Data -> Analyze
  goes deeper than Inspect; look for data improvements; look for unusual data (see below)
    example - find a person named Thomas born between 1801 and 1809 inclusive whose father was John Lake and mother was Henrietta
              other variables: where born, parents birth range, death range of person or parents, where lived, where buried, where born,
                names of known children, etc
              look in active DB or all DBs and/or on the Web or a specific site
              simple Search is via Search menu item; complex Search is here (Analyze; call it an analytical search)
                search for parents of a person
                search for spouse of a person
                search for children of a person
                search for siblings of a person
    https://www.google.com/search?q=analysis+of+genealogical+data&iflsig=AJiK0e8AAAAAY0hNbmpz91PQcKz45mN0EcY1F6cuh9Lf
    always give reasons for findings
    children firstname analysis in family groups and throughout lineages
      who is a child named for?
      children with the same name born to siblings makes it more likely that name is in the family history of their
        shared parent
    naming patterns
      this could be an important factor in finding a parent with an unknown surname;
        e.g., in 109.0 in the LakeFamily the mother's surname is unknown, Richard is the firstborn child,
        the name Richard does not appear in the father's parentage, perhaps the mother's father's name was Richard
        order of children - children naming pattern (different for different ethnicities)
        compare grandparents' names to childrens' names
      when a maiden name is unknown, a child's middle name (or first name) could be the mother's maiden name
    look for info online for a certain person
      compare to trees on:
        wikitree.com
        geni.com
        familysearch.org
        gedmatch.com
        ftdna.com
        ancestry.com (user supplies password)
    add "Suggest" or "Research Suggestions" based upon findings
    look for an unknown parent
    use children naming pattern
    use siblings naming pattern
    use locale
    estimate birth year
    estimate marriage year
    suggest a middlename for a person when there's only an initial
    suggest possible maiden names
    look in UnsureIfRelated directories for possible help
    look for possible missed connections in data
    look for possible duplicate families or duplicate individuals
      possible siblings in different families
      same couple with similar dates appearing in different family groups
    look for invalid place names (see WhenPlaceDoesntExist, https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/guides/authorities/place-authority, http://www.geonames.org/)
    look for possibilites for the birthname of a woman when unknown
    look for possibilites for unknown parents
    look at Questions, pose possible answers/solutions
    check citations against Questions ensuring the correct citation is used to show the data in Timeline &/or Notes (e.g., if the stronger
      citation (a record is stronger than another person's research for instance) is used to show the data in a Question rather than in the
      Timeline or Notes, correct or alert user)
    if mother maiden name is unknown, look for children given & middle names which do not occur in father's
      ancestry - those first/middle names could be the mother's maiden name
    DNA analysis
      https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/

Miscellaneous Functions -> Set Focus ID for Active DataBase
  bug - in a test DB, there was one Family Group; the DB imported successfully (with no focus ID specified), Verified successfully,
          and Inspected successfully
        the begining portion of the Family Group looked like:
          ---START---
          1.0  Richard Robbins
          Father - Richard Robbins
          Mother - Mary ------

          Timeline -
                 1716 Cybil Reaves born [1]
          ---STOP---
        tried to use this function to set the Focus ID to 1.0 and nothing happened
          there seemed to be a loop in processing

Miscellaneous Functions -> Copy Active DataBase
  add email as an option for output 
  add printing as an option for output
    print only Family Data, Citation material & images of people (let user know)
    count # of pages to print in CopyDB() function & alert user - if it's a high number make sure it stands out in alert
      # of pages = ((# EOLs in Family Data + all included Reference files) / 60) + includeCitations.length + includePeople.length
  when user enters a name for HOF, use Fuse to search and present user with matches to choose from
  when selecting Family Group, allow user to select # of descendant generations & # of ancestor generations to include

  processName() - when omitting, add all states, Canada provinces, et al
    however, some states can be proper names for people (e.g., Montana, York, et al)
  modify code so that all name pickups use function findProperName()
  add option to index personal names in files in Reference directory
  in all Sections, need to pick up names not after/before key words; e.g., in the following line only Nelson Abbott is currently picked up
      27 Mar 1861 Nelson Abbott, David Dunham and Miller Kline appointed to divide lands of estate of Evans Godown Lake [3]
  do Children -
  in Questions -, in lines containing "refers to" or "refer to" check for name after " as "
  never pick up 1-position surnames
  never pick up "SSN"
  in Citations/Citation, in lines containing 2 quotes, after picking up author name look for a second name after " and "
  in 112.19 (LAKE DB), "Anthonius Jansen Lanen van Pelt" is being index as "van, Anthonius Jansen Lanen"
  in 111.47 (LAKE DB), "Mayken Hendricks van den Burchgraeff" is being indexed as "van den, Mayken Hendricks"
  in 17.592, 110.33 & 110.103 (LAKE DB), "James Maher)" is being indexed as Maher), James"

  other places
  write a program to go through all SOT-related files and renumber people 
    starting at 1.0 (rather than 1.) & to get rid of all reference numbers containing more than
      one decimal point (will have to change any references, also & picture IDs,
      refs in images, references on hard copy photos), also double the number

Miscellaneous Functions -> Non-Family DataBase Timeline File
  allow user to create/edit/delete/validate a Timeline file
  create:
    this would necessitate editing the setup page for the Timeline Report
    this would necessitate editing the source code as it is currently
    perhaps creating/adding Timeline file could be a separate function; Timeline Report Form will need to acommodate
      user-created Timeline files (perhaps this would be a type of add-on To MELGenKey)
      provide a form which can be filled in to update/create a Timeline
    perhaps allow for additions ahead of time in the source code & setup page for the Timeline Report
    Timeline file would need to be validated before adding
  validate:
    a ] followed by a whitespace followed by a numeric *could* indicate a format error
    validate date
      col 1 whitespace, 1, 2, or 3
      col 2 whitespace or numeric
        if whitespace, col 1 must be whitespace
      col 3 whitespace
      col 4-6 whitespace or valid alpha abbreviated month
      col 7 whitespace, if year present can be c C -, if date between 1 Jan and 25 Mar and year 1752 or earlier can be d
      col 8-11 whitespace or numeric; no embedded whitespace, but leading characters can be whitespace
      col 12 whitespace or numeric
      col 13 if col 12 numeric must be whitespace; otherwise must be non-whitespace
      col 1-14 whitespace if continuation line; if so, col 15 must be non-whitespace
    look for possible redundant timeline events
      two events, same day & month, different year - look for some matching words
      event entry, year only - look for dated events in the same year with some matching words
      event entry, month & year only - look for dated events in the same month & year with some matching words
      two event entries, same full date - look for some matching words
      look for two consecutive dates exactly the same
    validate date sequencing
    consecutive duplicate dates
    validate format
      no blank lines
      date format
      indent following line 2 positions if continuation line (can be more than one)
      column 12 blank
      column 13 can be -, but if it is it must be followed by a valid date
      Citations
      Citation refs present & valid
      column 13 cannot be space unless it's an indented line then column 15 cannot be blank
    if date (columns 1-11) not specific try to find a specific date for event

Miscellaneous Functions -> Monitor Web Pages for Content Changes
  change system alert to dialog
  will need to handle login/password for pages which require a login
  allow user to set time and, if weekly or monthly, day/date check performed (cron job run)
  add ability to optionally look for changes in any links or files called by the Web Address
    (a full blown traversing, recursive check)
  add button to reset to before previous Save
  add button to clear settings
  add options for user to be notified of a page content change via an email or both alert & email
  add text to lower half of page telling user when next check is scheduled (like in ManageRecurRep.html)
  need to handle notifications not sent/delivered because client is offline (see Notes/QueuedSSEMessages.txt)

Miscellaneous Functions -> Manage Recurring Reports
  if Family DataBase option selected, verify specified DB in parameters exists (if DB no longer exists, Family DataBase in form will
    be selected but no Family DB will be selected/specified in form; however the old FamDB will still be specified in parameters internally)
  if user X's tab, if there have been unsaved changes, use beforeunload to alert user
  might need to change how reports are listed/displayed (if there are many reports it might be too clumsy the way it is)
    it might be better to use select/option (see MonitorWeb.html)
  encrypt password before saving; decrypt before using
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/encrypt
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18279141/javascript-string-encryption-and-decryption
  show password on form as asterisks
    add "Show" toggle to show actual password (make this optional by adding it to User Preferences)
  allow for HTML email (looks like it can be done via nodemailer by just setting a parameter)
  allow user to set frequency of report (daily, weekly, monthly, etc)
  optionally format email to limit text to column 75, and indent continuation lines
    see clib.js
  allow multiple entry fields for Family DB Name & to whom email is being sent
  when FamDB not included, set FamDBName to null in OTDRecur object
  validate that FamDBName exists

  Question - What date to use for change-over to USA when specifying location?
    Solution - let user select which change-over date to use:
    2 Jul 1776 - Continental Congress voted to separate from Great Britain
    DEFAULT:
    4 Jul 1776 - adoption of the Declaration of Independence by the Continental Congress
                 America declared it's independence
                 Continental Congress proclaimed the separation of the 13 colonies from Great Britain

    19 Sep 1781 - British General Charles Cornwallis surrendered in Yorktown, Virginia
    3 Sep 1783 - Treaty of Paris (ending Rev War) signed
    another option could be for the time span between two dates (4 Jul 1776 & 3 Sep 1783) to use an either/or in
      the place name (e.g., Georgia, also called Province of Georgia, Royal Colony of Great Britain)

  incorporate audio (e.g., option to play "Taps" at people who died in service)
  incorporate video
  change date format in MLB Timeline events from "month day, year" or "month day" to "dd mmm yyyy" or "dd mmm"
  any location citation in any DB should be able to be seen as both at the time of the event and present day

  From: Richard Carruthers <leliwite@gmail.com>

  I would love to see an adaptation of the form used in the various publications
  of Burke's Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage (i.e.  Burke's Landed Gentry
  (originally Burke's Commoners), Burke's Colonial Gentry, and Burke's
  Family Records, etc.). It's called the indented narrative pedigree and I
  much prefer it to some of the descendancy reports popularised by the New
  England Historic Genealogical Society (Hist. Gen.).
  
  I have done mine by hand for over 850 pages (so far) to document my study
  of the ERNLE family originally of Earnley, Sussex, from earliest times. I
  am up to 23 indented generations, each one slightly further indented
  than the last. It may be a bit harder to follow than some formats due to
  its repetition of numbering between members of the same generation as the
  family grows and splits over the generations, but that could, presumably be
  adapted. Personally I didn't opt for that as I don't care for the sometimes
  long and unwieldy alphanumeric individual prefixes used by some systems
  as I find them unsightly, but that is a matter of taste (and, of course,
  ease of navigation).

  The indented narrative pedigree form can be adapted to work backwards in a
  direct ancestry report that includes siblings and their descendants working
  with the forward system at the same time. Indeed, my kinsman and godson,
  L. H. T. "Tam" Large, of Streat, Sussex has developed precisely this sort
  of report, though it is all done by hand.

  Another very useful report is an adjustable tree drawing format that allows
  one to build, see, alter, and print pedigree charts. Most of the ones I have
  seen use even spacing and waste a lot of paper whereas ideally the format
  should be adjustable to that one can close up blank and drop generations
  down further in than their "true" position in order to cram more into the
  space provided. The ability to omit generations or refer one to another
  chart for further elucidation would also be great.

  formerly a boarder in Lake's House, Shawnigan Lake School, Vancouver
  Island, British Columbia, named after the first chairman of the Board of
  Governors, General Sir Percy Lake and his brother, Sir Richard Lake, sometime
  lieutenant-governor of Saskatchewan, whose five sons all went to Shawnigan
  and were in Lake's: scions of the English Lake family of baronetcy fame.

  websockets on node, when closed to Internet ...

  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy)

  monitor Family DBs for changes; if changed, modify MELGenKeyInfo.txt & save (force [re]verification); delete HTML version of DB
    it appears the only way to do this with any accuracy is to first check for existing/removed body files and/or index file in PlainText
      directory of a Family DB and then create a hash value for all body files & the index file in the PlainText directory of a Family DB
      (this info would need to be saved in a file (or files) in order to accomplish this across runnings of node)
    ask if message should be sent to DB author

  allow comments in file MELGenKeyInfo.txt
    add comments to MELGenKeyInfo.txt explaining possible values of all the keys
    add comment that it is an auto-generated file; do not edit directly; edit directly at your own risk

  anytime an ID is entered for any function, show some info (e.g., name, birthdate, death date, names of parents, etc) so user can
    confirm it's the correct ID

  allow for on-line DBs (familysearch, ancestry, wikitree, etc) to be updated with data from MELGenKey & vice-versa (with user permission)

  when there is a (Sr) or a (I) then all people in that line with same name should be further ID'ed to ensure user identifies proper
    person (i.e, there should be a (Jr))
  include a list of photos for all versions (HTML, PDF & plain text)
  PDF format - will user be able to include embedded images in a printout (since the images will be linked in) ?
  offer plain text files in two formats ... one for UNIX and one for Windows (or emplement code which will convert as needed for user)
  transcription/OCR tool for digital files - tesseract
  do 2 indexes ? ... 1 for names appearing in book and 1 for names appearing in References/* and Images/* which do NOT appear in book
    and maybe a third for names appearing in Sources
    and a fourth for names appearing in photos
  include a place-index or an appendix of places
  add an index/appendix listing all people in book in Civil War, War of 1812, Rev War, WWI, WWII, Spanish-American War, etc
    (this will be done programically in MELGenKey)
    make this a function or add it to an already existing function
  write a program to change all surnames to all upper case ? (if all surnames were in upper case it would make auto-creating an index easier)
    write program to create an index - every word (except personal names) which can appear in Timelines, Notes, Questions, etc should appear
      in a reserved word list; then picking out personal names to index will be easier
    can I use fuse to create an index?
  write a program to remove the periods after initials ? only in the index ?
  change numbering scheme ... or keep same scheme and add two or three
    new generations (add one or two to number)
    one possibility ... instead of using 0.*, 0.0.*, etc use - sign or BC
      or something else to identify generations before 1.
    scheme should be 1.1, 1.2 ... 1.x; 2.1, 2.2 .... 2.x; 3.1, 3.2 ... 3.x, etc
      parents should always be the same left number, e.g., I would be 1.1, my father would be 2.1 and my mother would be 2.2
      using this scheme there's always a number to the right of the decimal point and the number to the left of the decimal point is
        a true representation of generation
    redo numbering scheme for distant ancestors ... use 200., 300., 400., etc
  write program to check the format of a text file based upon template
    file(s) (n = numeric, a = alpha, A = cap alpha, s = special chars,
    x = any character, somehow allow specific chars; follow format with
    min & max # of chars; begin-of-record marker, end-of-record delimiter;
    rules for entire doc - spellcheck)
  in the index somehow make the main family reference for each individual
    stand out (comment on it in the preface) (or maybe there should be index entries when the person only appears in the Father or Mother line?)
    perhaps do this only in HTML version
  use images from wpclipart in the PDF version (and the HTML version?)
    google for "genealogy images" ... lots available
    images to use -
      an American flag at each individual who served in the Armed Services
  PDF version - add an index by page number
  set up printing capabilities on lulu.com or other publishing sites
  PDF version - compare index to images versus plain text version to ensure all images are included
  check for places where no county is specified but county is named for that place in another place in info
  PDF version -
    embed links to images rather than the images themselves (question - how will that print?)
    PDF version should have clickable links
  allow user to display map overlays (e.g., a Hammond map could overlay a modern Hunterdon Co map to show where things are located in present day)
  offer context-sensitive help
    show the relationship of user to person as cursor rolls over name
    pay attention to User Preferences
  add an audio story to BOOK
  give user ability to speak text
  offer downloadable updates
  allow user to specify margins, column width for plain text or HTML version
    prioritize where to break by semi-colon, comma, space
  user options for all/any output:
    date display format
      option to suppress leading zero in dd
      option to suppress leading zero in mm
      mm/dd/yyyy
      dd/mm/yyyy
      dd mmm yyyy (e.g., 22 Mar 1949)
      ddmmmyyyy (e.g., 22Mar1949)
      fullmonth, dd, yyyy
      dd fullmonth yyyy
    always include (or not) relationship to user for any/every name displayed
    beginning column for output
    ending column for output
    display/print/both (print to file, hard copy or both ... if file, what format (plain text, HTML, PDF, etc))

      and for printing them. Here are set of features that I would like to achieve,
      or as close as possible:

  1. Flexible choice of which people to show on the tree, not just ancestors,
     descendants or fan charts. For example, it should be possible to select
     "all my direct ancestors for 7 generations, plus all their descendants
     for 2 generations, plus all other spouses with their descendants for
     2 generations". Personal Ancestral File has a pretty good tool for
     selecting such sets of people.
  2. A variety of choices of chart format and style, including box charts.
  3. Choice of which types of data to include in the chart.
  4. Intelligent chart layout to minimise the length of long links, and
     put closely related people close together, and make the chart easy to
     navigate, and to minimise the number of pages...
  5. Intelligent layout onto pages, so boxes don't overlap page breaks etc.
  6. Printed layouts can either be a single large page, printed tiled so the
     sheets can be stuck together, or multiple sheets of a selectable size
     with labels showing where links go off one page and reappear on another,
     page borders, page numbers etc.
  7. You can manually adjust the automatic layout, and such adjustments can
     optionally be saved and reapplied even if the automatic layout process
     is re-done, including if there are changes to the chart. Obviously
     the changes may be such as to make the manual adjustments meaningless,
     in which case they are abandoned.
  8. For web based display, the ability to pan and zoom around the chart,
     and maybe other "quick navigation" tools.
  9. For web based display, intelligent tools allowing one to quickly find any
     person of interest, to see easily whereabouts on the full chart one is
     so one doesn't get "lost", to see how the person of interest is related
     to yourself or to people well known to you etc. These tools must work
     even if the whole chart is too large to see legibly on one screen.
  10. Relationship markers show how each person on the chart is related to
      a selected "key" person.
  11. Links from each individual and marriage on the chart to more detailed
      information about the person/marriage.
  12. Optional facility to omit certain information about living people,
      or optionally to omit them altogether.

  RootsMagic features ... http://wiki.rootsmagic.com/wiki/RootsMagic_8:Feature_List

  handle all errors properly

  whenever copying or outputing data, optionally do not include people born after YYYY (set by user) unless (optionally) there is a death event
    for that person; allow for living people to be included in a particular line (e.g., if a copy of the DB was being sent to a living
    descendant the line to the living descendant might want to be included)

  whenever copying or outputing data, option to make surnames all caps

  auto-update the user's on-line trees (info, sources, etc)

  integrate map display
    https://morioh.com/p/58ee45843ccf
    perhaps: user clicks on location in Family DB which brings up a map of the area (state, county, township, etc) showing boundary lines at the
      time referenced where the user clicked (e.g., clicking on a Timeline entry for "1860 living in Broome County, New York" brings up a map of
      Broome Co, NY in 1860); and allow user to input a year in order to change the map and its boundary lines

  integrate a CLI and/or email interface capable of performing certain functions like some Reports, some Miscellaneous Functions, etc without
      having to execute MELGenKey

  search factor:
    group families who moved to same areas
      take into account timing
      don't take into account timing
    how related?

  show distance, map, route between locales
    find "traveled routes" at the time
    might be two families
    might just show movement of one family
    might be between two places

  search genealogy on youtube
    perhaps I will find free sites for MELGenKey to use
    or other stuff

    Plain Text Family display
    Reference pages that are displayed via HTML display

  Import
    figure sequence of multiple body & text files based upon contents of files (key off family ID numbers) so that they are sequenced
      properly when copied to DBs
    add an option on form for message to be sent to data creator after successful import (if not available in Other files then allow user to
      enter an email address)
    check for amount of free space before importing
    add an option on form to verify DB when it's imported
    when ID entered show user info (e.g., name, birthdate, death date, parents names, etc) so that user can confirm it's the correct ID
    allow for child to be entered in ID field (e.g., 28.3, child iii)
    allow user to provide two tableofcontents files, one for PlainText directory and one for top level directory

  allow for a tableofcontents file in each directory and sub-directory
    MELGenKey should always look for a tableofcontents file first when accessing directories and sub-directories

  in column 7 in Timeline section of DB allow < for before and > for after

  limit string lengths to 200MB; let user know when limit reached
    check already included in Search Report
    for rdata (a report), check size at each "rdata +=", if over, stop processing report, let user know,
      and send back what there is at this point in the report processing
    for [some] reports may have to check as report is accumulated since the entire report may be added to rdata at once
    for log files, when max length reached, save file and attach date & time to filename
      use User Preferences:  NumLFiles and LogSize
      write log to a file when client disconnects or any global exception or size > 200MB; save # of files based upon User
        Preferences (default 5 days worth); check for, and delete, old files when writing new files)
    read file if need be when sending log messages to client
    add a function to display log files

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34957890/javascript-string-size-limit-256-mb-for-me-is-it-the-same-for-all-browsers
    We do storage of large JSON, or XML strings by defining the attribute data
    type as Binary. Then using TextToBinary from the Binary espace to convert
    the text prior to storing it, and BinaryToText to convert it back to a text
    after reading it. Now you do not have to worry about size property of the
    attribute. You could decide to redesign your entity and create a 1 on 1
    entity just to store the binary separate from the other attributes of your
    entity, with the primary key set to the identifier of your original table.

  add Family DB version # to HTML pages
  add "created by MELGenKey vyyyymmmdd" to HTML pages
  add a button (3 buttons?) to HTML version of DB which shows version, development history, contact info
  add "font size" to HTML pages (like https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/1/ - click "Settings" at top of page)

  at MELGenKey install time:
    get info
      user's info
      password protect this file (where user info will be) so others can't change it
      option whether or not to allow incoming access from the outside
        require outsiders to log-in or not
      install location (must be a writeable directory/folder)
      optionally message me (via nodejs)
        you will receive alerts when MELGenKey is updated
    allow to uninstall MELGenKey

  if pop-ups are blocked by browser, certain windows are not being displayed

  ideas
    Tom Whetmore <ttwetmore4@gmail.com>: group records which then get
    collectively and maybe iteratively "merged" together into a final set of
    "real person" GEDCOM records. Persons records become the collection of
    all evidence you have discovered about them.

    Przemek Wiech <pwiech@gmail.com>: integration between the various information sources.
    The current workflow is manually copying information from somewhere. What
    is missing is automation that would take data from online databases and
    match and merge them into your own database.
    I imagine building a pipeline of separate pieces of software that do these
    tasks, each task being a totally separate program:
    - extract data from an online database
    - convert data between different formats, e.g. GEDCOM <-> Gramps XML
    - match data to data in my database (automatic or interactive) and output a
      file with the matches
    - merge the data into my database (automatic or interactive)
 
    Przemek Wiech <pwiech@gmail.com>: build a database of sources that haven't
    matched to my database yet and I don't know if and how they match. For
    example, I'd like to keep a list of all people with a certain last name
    who were born in a certain village. At some point it's possible that I'll
    connect them to my family tree.

  handle non-ASCII characters (Unicode)
    apply the function convertToAscii(string) only when printing (is that enough?)

  maps
    http://gis.co.hunterdon.nj.us/HistoricBoundaries/

  allow directory structure to be anything
    preserve directory structure when importing DB
    when importing Gedcom, allow user to specify structure in form

  CROSS TESTING:
  try Chrome, Safari, Edge, Epiphany, Chromebook (using both ChromeOS & Linux)
    include in Readme.html which hardware has been tested & which browsers have been tested

  TESTING:
    remove active DB by hand; see what happens when accessed
    remove DBs directory & contents by hand; what happens?
    edit/delete MELGenKeyInfo.txt; what happens?
    edit Other/DBinfo.txt; what happens?

  for possible ideas, see https://genealogysoftware.net/
    Family Historian and Ancestral Sources, Behold, Scrivener and Scapple, Evidentia, MacFamilyTree, GenSmarts, Clooz, and IrfanView

  General Notes & Notes for Active DB
    set focus in textarea after Save

  add MELGenKey to heading of any output

  when setting up outgoing email (ManageRecurRep.html and OnThisDay.html)
    make Port: a drop-down menu selection containing Port: 587, 465, 2525
      make 587 the default
      ensure text can be entered by user for other port numbers
      when a user enters settings and attempts to send a test email, provide feedback if it fails:
        "Connection refused: Please check the host and port number."
        "Authentication failed: Please check your username and password."
        "TLS/SSL negotiation failed: Try a different port or encryption method."

  develop a method to score the quality (Quality Score) of info for each family (100 best, 0 worst, show details/factors)
    and perhaps a quality score for each relationship (parents/child, spouses)
    take score into account with certain other functions (e.g., Analyze, Inspect, et al)
    factors:
      primary evidence
        parents named in primary evidence
        parents not named in primary evidence
        other identifying info
      secondary evidence
        parents named in secondary evidence
        parents not named in secondary evidence
        other identifying info
      circumstantial evidence
      original record vs transcription
      number of citations regarding the same fact
    offer suggestions to improve score
    see "rate citations" elsewhere

  change to allow multiple options without user having to hold down a key
    this will affect functions: Timeline Report, On This Day, Manage Recurring reports, General User Preferences
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8641729/how-to-avoid-the-need-for-ctrl-click-in-a-multi-select-box-using-javascript

  add to omits (affects On This Day report, Timeline report & Manage Recurring Reports)
    events for children (any event containing "child #")
    events containing any unknown names ("------")

  expand upon the contents of Docs/MenuItemsDesc.html

  at import, if table of contents file exists in import directory, it is copied to MELGenKey DB area, if it doesn't exist it is created
    if table of contents file exists, it could contain bad info
    what to do about that?
      one option is to always create the table of contents file but if the user had special info in the file it would be lost

  add
    list of all most distant ancestors (people with unknown parents)
    hierarchical chart (tree)
      entire DB
      one particular line
    synopsis/summary of a Family Group (names, living/deceased (with years) for each individual, child has own family, etc)

  ability to convert between different Gedcom versions

  all reported error messages in Verify, Inspect, Analyze, et al would include a link to the cited place in the plain text data;
    the link, when clicked, should bring up an editor for the user to change the data (anytime any contents of a plain text family DB is
    changed, the DB should be marked as changed and unverified)

  country-county codes
    perhaps use at user's option
    https://www.genuki.org.uk/big/Regions/Codes   and-or   Notes/Extras/County-Codes-1.xlsx

  free genealogy sites to perhaps add to Include/SiteList.txt
    https://familyhistorydaily.com/genealogy-resources/50-free-genealogy-sites/

  perhaps after reading Family DB I should create a binary tree filling it with the root ID and the parents IDs of all Family Groups
    in the DB --- perhaps that would make other processes faster (like some reports)

  anywhere a function is referenced in docs or Other, clicking on reference should bring up function
    in Other, will need to do it when DB is imported

  how does an outsider access a MELGenKey DB ? will they need to run MELGenKey on their system? (I think yes)

  Info for All DBs
    list all:
      imported DBs
      backed up DBs
      active DB
      deported DBs
      re-imported
      edited
      verified
      size

  if I provide an update to a DB but not an update to MELGenKey, do I need to provide another file for download which is MELGenKey-ready
    and will replace the DB in the DBs directory when installed?

  look into using a script to start MELGenKey server & client

  instructions for installing new version of MELGenKey & retaining DBs

  use strict in JS modules

  change structure of user-created files to be imported to look exactly like the structure after import
    is the only change to have a PlainText directory?
    this way, a user can copy a DB directly to the MELGenKey DBs directory
      the MELGenKeyInfo.txt file will need to be created/updated
      the DBinfo.txt file will need to be created/appended
    does a DB even need to be installed?
      instead of installing, a pointer to DB just needs to be set

  bugs
    sorting reference numbers in index not right (by line - references within the same index entry sorting ok; 41.52 sorting ahead of 5.1127)

    General Notes & Notes for Active DB
      if no notes, user enters some stuff, doesn't save, refreshes, gets alert saying no notes, but the stuff user entered remains on screen
      if some notes, user enters some more stuff, doesn't save, refreshes, textarea display reverts to what it was before
        more stuff was entered by user
      either is fine (I think) but it should be consistent
    formatted printing - the way it is currently, if user cancels the formatted print, it cannot be reset or formatted again to a
      different column width
    Inspect - get errors; don't kill node; use separate terminal to correct errors; rerun Inspect; got same errors even though they're corrected

      analysis (determination, clues, hints) for unknown children
      analysis (determination, clues, hints) for unknown siblings

  sometimes takes too long on all pages to determine node/server is down before disabling certain buttons

  check4ActiveDB() in clib.js doesn't seem to be functioning as a promise (see MELGenKey.js & JS/OnThisDay.js)
  in any html file, any references or pointers (->) should be clickable
